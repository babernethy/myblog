Advice from Bill Gates is worth noting â€“ full link / transcript below â€“ here are the highlights.

1. "Working knowledge of **productivity software**" â€“ I'll buy that, word processing, spreadsheets, presentation, e-mail, etc. (yes I know that's what he sells)
2. "Good background in **math and science**" â€“ Of course ðŸ™‚
3. "**Communication skills**" â€“ Yes
4. "Ability to work well with **different types of people**" â€“ Important
5. "**Innovation** requires the ability to **collaborate** and share ideas" â€“ And creativity (the only surprise for me was he didn't mention creativity)
6. "Passion for **ongoing learning**" â€“ I like how he puts that one, you are never "done" learning
7. "**Curiosity** about the world" â€“ Nice. How do you encourage someone to be curious?

Not an exhaustive list, but sure reads like many of the questions we use for interviewing new team members.
