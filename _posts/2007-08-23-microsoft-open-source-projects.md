*Some say that Open Source != Microsoft, and that they are even polar opposites. I disagree and this nice recap from the “Programming Resources’ blog basically proves that Microsoft Open Source Projects are alive and well. Below are nine of the projects I have used (on projects or at home – including my current Blog using BlogEngine.NET) and some that I need to check out. Find many more and the details at the original post. – Bruce*
