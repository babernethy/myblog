After a really busy summer I am making an effort to get back into a routine which includes posting about some interesting things going on personally, professionally, and otherwise.

I thought a “soft-launch” back into it would be sharing one of my pet-peeves of the day.

The “insult to injury” here is the “Did you find what you wanted?” phrase – because apparently the little doggy did find a lot of things I probably wanted to see, but refused to show them to me.

From a Test-Driven Development perspective wouldn’t you do a simple count of the items on the right and match to the “found” number on the left?
