I just want to see if I can actually do a blog post using Jott, let's see if this works.

**UPDATE:** The above was sent via cell phone, transcribed and e-mailed by Jott.com, then post-processed by a quick program I wrote (code soon) and posted automatically to the blog. Which means I can speak a blog post at any time from anywhere. Wild. Now I just need to figure out how/why this would be useful.
