So you are up to almost midnight (late night at work or at the bar) and decide to take a shortcut home on the highway, only to come face-to-face with a semi-truck loaded with 42,000 pounds of carrots. Keeping in mind that 42,000 pounds is roughly 19,000kg and 70mph is roughly 30m/s, so the carrot-car impact had a minimum of 8.5 mega joules of energy (roughly 2kg of TNT). A tragedy in any terms, but quite dramatic – hope the guy is ok.
