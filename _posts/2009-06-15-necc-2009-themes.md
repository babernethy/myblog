NECC is the National Educational Computing Conference put on yearly by the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) (<http://center.uoregon.edu/ISTE/NECC2009/>). This is the group that sets national standards for technology in education, and brings together creative and intelligent speakers and attendees for a lively discussion each year. I’ve been to the conference twice, presented once, but haven’t been in the last 10 years. I do remember it fondly and follow the outcomes when I can from afar.

This year I was impressed to see a planned debate at the conference with the provocative topic, “Bricks and Mortar Schools are Detrimental to the Future of Education”. It will be interesting to hear the outcome of that.

I speed-skimmed the program over lunch and found the following list of topics/themes. My main goal is to learn a little about the ones that are completely foreign to me, see the themes that never seem to change, and wonder why there are some topics missing at a conference in 2009.
