Yes, I subscribe to one of those "daily quote" widgets â€“ but today's just seemed to strike me as funny (having dealt with health care a lot in the last month, listening to the debates lately, and it is always good to get Scotland into a quote whenever possible).

> <dl><dt>We Americans live in a nation where the medical-care system is second to none in the world, unless you count maybe 25 or 30 little scuzzball countries like Scotland that we could vaporize in seconds if we felt like it. </dt><dd>**[Dave Barry](http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes/Dave_Barry/)**  
>  *US columnist &amp; humorist (1947 â€“ )*</dd></dl>

Seems to sum up well at least one side of the debate ðŸ™‚
