[![meijer_vista](http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/mirror/PetPeeve26_67B6/meijer_vista_thumb.png)](http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/mirror/PetPeeve26_67B6/meijer_vista.png) I didn’t get up early for shopping on Friday, but there were some really good deals (including percent off coupons) that helped buy even the basics. If you needed a big flat screen TV, a laptop, a GPS, or any other big ticket item then there were deals to be had. I talked to one guy who got to Best Buy slightly after 3AM (ouch).

I was looking at games (for the kids) and came across something that set me off a bit – enough to warrant a picture.

This is a sale tag from a local mass-market retailer that caught my eye for several reasons.

First, it isn’t a temporary sale tag (i.e. Friday-Saturday only) but a “price drop” which seems like a semi-permanent reduction.

Second (which should have been first) is that I don’t remember operating systems being sold at mass-market chains before, but I guess that isn’t too strange. Everyone should upgrade, right?!?

Third, this is the [“Home Basic”](http://reviews.cnet.com/windows/microsoft-vista-home-basic/4505-3672_7-32013641.html) version of Vista which lacks many of the coolest features of Vista including the “Aero” user interface, integrated search, etc. In fact I can’t think of a significant reason to go from Windows XP to Vista Home Basic – especially with [Service Pack 3 for XP](http://www.winbeta.org/comments.php?id=9012&catid=1) due out early next year (for stability an minor functionality enhancements).

Finally, the “elephant in the room” is obviously the math (see for yourself). I had heard about some of the math issues in [Excel 2007](http://www.accountingweb.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=104050&d=883&h=884&f=882&dateformat=%25o%20%25B%20%25Y) and early [Pentium chips](http://www.willamette.edu/~mjaneba/pentprob.html) but …..
