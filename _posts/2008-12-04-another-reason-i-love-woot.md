You may or may not know about the [www.woot.com](http://www.woot.com) site where they sell one item per day until it is gone at really good prices. That’s cool, and there are great deals, but they also have a sense of humor which is lacking in most retail situations. The latest example of this is a status note I got yesterday on a product that was a few weeks late in shipping. I don’t know if any of it is true, but it is kind of funny, and the order did ship a few hours later …

| Dear Bruce,  Our records indicate you purchased the Star Wars Vault 30 years of Treasures item from us on Nov. 21. To better secure the collectible inside the box, we are taking extra precaution. The packaging has under gone several drop tests and throws to make sure that these will hold up during transit with FedEx.  We apologize for the delay and your patience. Tomorrow you will be receiving the tracking email.  Woot Member Services |

Keeping the internet a little less serious – nice. Hope the wrong person doesn’t read this post before Christmas … hmm.
