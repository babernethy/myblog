I was reading through the latest Despair, Inc. catalog when this shirt caught me off guard.

I read left-to-right, top-to-bottom (as most westerners do), so you get the "Made in America" and the little abstract flag, then BOOM, "By Robots". Woah! Funny … scary … hmmm.

This little saying says so much, especially in Michigan and growing up near Detroit (with Grandpa working for Dodge after coming over to America). We've been worried for so long about losing jobs to other countries (and rightly so). Now there is an additional risk of being replaced, but by a machine (as many white collar people already have been).

I guess the positive angle on the whole thing is that there is probably a bright future in robotics (and hopefully alternative energy too, but that's a different t-shirt).
