Thanks to all the people who filled the room for my session this weekend at the Beer City Code Conference in Grand Rapids. It was great to share a lot of this content, in a hopefully fun and interesting way.

I do want to blog on some of this, and perhaps screen capture the longer demo at the end, but here is a PDF/compressed version of the slide deck for anyone who was interested.
