I remember when all the [Chuck Norris “Facts”](http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com/) were going around a few years back, that the man himself went through several stages of acceptance of the whole fad. Well it looks like he has come around and actually is having some fun with it now.

This post is not intended as an endorsement of Huckabee, but I think [the ad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDUQW8LUMs8) is really creative.
