Just a general note to let anyone that cares that (1) [BlogEngine.NET 1.2 is out!!!](http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/post/Release-of-BlogEngineNET-12.aspx) and (2) I upgraded over lunch and it was relatively painless. I have to rebuild my blogroll and fix a couple settings but that was my mistake. Now I just need to update my ‚ÄúTalk Like a Pirate‚Äù plugin ‚Äì plenty of time before next year üôÇ

I can‚Äôt wait to get back into the code and see what we can really do now.
