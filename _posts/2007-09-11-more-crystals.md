Well it has been almost exactly a [month since we started](http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/post/Water-Weenies-and-Crystals.aspx) growing the “Alum” crystals, and about two weeks since we [harvested the first one](http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/post/First-Dangerous-Crystal.aspx) – now we have a complete first batch. Looks like someone’s struck it rich with a pocket full of diamonds …

Let’s go “macro” on the camera and add a little light …

It is interesting how many different shapes they are taking on.

We decided to continue the experiment and re-doubled the amount of solution in the beaker – then put all the original crystals back in as “seed crystals”. See you near the end of October for what might be the end of the experiment.

Rachel wanted to see what adding some color would do, so we mixed up some yellow-colored solution (which ended up looking an unfortunate shade of green) with a different chemical mixture. These may develop more quickly, and more dramatically, we’ll let you know
