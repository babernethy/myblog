For Valentine's Day this year, Laura wanted to have a lunchdate at someplace new.<span> </span>After a littlesearching she found a place in East Grand Rapids called Marie Catrib's <span> </span>– <http://www.mariecatribs.com/>. I checked it out online and figured out how to get there and we were off.

I can't begin to tell you how much we were impressed by theplace (didn't bring a camera – should have).<span> </span>First thing that really struck me was the "local" flavor ofthe place.<span> </span>Not only is it locally ownedand operated (like to promote the local economy) but most of their ingredientscome from local farms within a "scooter trip" from therestaurant.<span> </span>This means they use localfarms (and greenhouses in the winter) to get veggies, meat and cheeses.<span> </span>They even name the farms and offer summertours so you can buy food for home from local places too.<span> </span>The building itself was eco-friendly – likethe downtown YMCA and new Art Museum it is a LEED-certified building whichincludes a "live roof", passive solar, zero-rain-water shed,etc.<span> </span>They have a wide variety of foodand offer a lot of vegetarian and even vegan options, but also have home-madesausage (which I had in my Baker's Omelet).

There were probably 4-5 groups ahead of us when we gotthere, so the wait was about 20-25 minutes.<span> </span>During this time they had a cool coffee bar (I had organic vanilla hazelnut)and they came by three times with cinnamon rolls and seasoned pita chips.<span> </span>During the wait we looked over the Saturday menu(<http://www.mariecatribs.com/images/uploads/891Brunch0508.pdf>)and the amazing amount of take-home food they had ready-to-go (we took home somerice, hummus, and a monster cookie – all vegan, all good).

We are already planning a return visit – this time with thechildren (looked quite kid-friendly and good options for them).<span> </span>I had never heard of the place before Lauramentioned it, but can't figure out how we missed it.
