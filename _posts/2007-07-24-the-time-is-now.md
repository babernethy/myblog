It was unique, new, inspired and completely undiscovered, just what we love so we honored it in our daily email and now the internet is all atwitter trying to decide, do they or, don’t they, like it?

[You](http://www.thisnext.com/item/02522C7E/NOW-Watch) said it “teaches you to live in the moment. It’s inspirational,” [we](http://www.thisnext.com/item/02522C7E/EEBEB465/NOW-Watch) said, “The simple statement is a reminder to you live in the moment,” and now [Oh Gizmo!](http://www.ohgizmo.com/2007/07/16/the-now-watch-the-most-accurate-time-piece-ever-invented/) said it’s “the most accurate time piece ever invented,” [Shiny Shiny](http://www.shinyshiny.tv/2007/07/whats_the_time.html) said it’s “so post-post-post-modern,” and [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/the-time-is-nigh/now-watch-is-always-right-278824.php) said, “You can’t argue with its correctitude.”
