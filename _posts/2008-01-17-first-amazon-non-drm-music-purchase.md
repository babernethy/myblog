[![jeffdaniels_](http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/FirstAmazonnonDRMmusicpurchase_6F2C/jeffdaniels__3.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Live-Unplugged-Benefit-Purple-Theatre/dp/B000QQX1ZY) So I’ve wanted to try out a “non-DRM” music purchase on Amazon to see how it works. I have purchased several iTunes albums and singles that are forever lost in iTunes-limbo because I did not de-authorize and re-authorize computers (or burn them to CD) correctly. I have a media server in the house and several iPods and would like to be able to listen to my music where I want to. I also want to pay for the music I listen to often – pay a fair price.

So my first “One-Click MP3 Album” purchase is [Jeff Daniels, Live and Unplugged](http://www.amazon.com/Live-Unplugged-Benefit-Purple-Theatre/dp/B000QQX1ZY). At work, Kevin had been playing some of the tracks from Jeff’s albums and they really resonated with me – I like folk music, funny music, and have grown up in Michigan – so it is all good. I have relatives up north and have nearly experienced scenes from [Escanaba in da Moonlight](http://www.amazon.com/Escanaba-da-Moonlight-Joey-Albright/dp/B00006HAX7).

So try out some samples online, you might just like tunes like “If William Shatner Can, I Can Too”, “The Lifelong Tiger Fan Blues”, “If I Weren’t So Stupid, You Wouldn’t Be So Smart”, or even a more thoughtful piece in “Michigan, My Michigan”.

Oh, and if you buy it DRM-free you can listen to it on your iPod, in Media Player on your PC, stream it to your TiVo, or rip it to a CD if that’s your thing. And the artist (and in this case a charity) get the money for their work. It’s all good.
