 Just a quick note out to say what a great day Saturday was at the Ann Arbor “Day of .Net”. Where else can you see and talk to a lot of people doing great work in Michigan (and elsewhere), learn to program an XBOX game, see how to add 3D models to the Visual Earth database and embed them in any web page, figure out all you are doing wrong with Ajax, and see the future of services, user interfaces, etc. (oh, and possibly win an Nerf gun and lots of other great stuff).

It was a perfect day for driving through the state too – great weather and fall color in full splendor (and no competition with any football traffic :-).

I’m looking forward to getting started helping with the local Grand Rapids “Day of .Net” for next year. These days are a great supplement to the user group meetings and CodeMash type events.
