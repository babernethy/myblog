If you do “get” to work in a cube, I’d want a cube like this one.

There is a great [gallery](http://www.theqube.co.uk/gallery.php) on the “[Qube](http://www.theqube.co.uk/)” site where it shows you all the options of this great concept.

If I ever have a job where I work from home the majority of the time, I’d think I would need a space that was separate from the house (in a way that was not in the “traffic flow” of all the other family members, was “sonically isolated” from other activity, but still accessible when appropriate. I think this little beauty would suffice – nice video conferencing options, a place to work on the computer, place to read and meet with a handful of people, and only a few steps from fresh air and “reality”.
