This will certainly take a few months to really understand and process, but today’s public preview release of the ASP.NET 3.5 Extensions is really a big deal.

What do we get to look forward to? For all the details, [see the download page](http://asp.net/downloads/3.5-extensions/) – here are the highlights from my perspective.

1. ASP.NET MVC – a model-view-controller framework “burned in” to the .NET Framework. It’s about time and I can’t wait for a project to try this out on. [ScottGu](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/09/asp-net-3-5-extensions-ctp-preview-released.aspx) has details on this and has been doing a very detailed series of “how-tos” in anticipation of this day. Lots of power and potential here.
2. New Ajax stuff – Back-button support – enough said!
3. ADO.NET Entity Framework – goodbye NHibernate?
4. ADO.NET Data Services (i.e. Astoria) – again a lot here, but having REST/JSON/XML native methods and structures is another hotly anticipated feature set (not to mention all the rest in this library).
5. Silverlight Controls for ASP.NET – wow it just keeps getting better. A Silverlight MediaPlayer control (yes – &lt;asp:MediaPlayer /&gt; is now a reality) for drag-and-drop implementation of audio and video in your web pages, and a server control &lt;asp:Silverlight /&gt; to enable ASP.NET to reference the XAML objects and their events. Combine with the above to get best-in-class integration of rich UI elements with active web content and data.
6. Finally – [Quickstarts](http://quickstarts.asp.net/3-5-extensions/) to get you going.

Merry Christmas!!!

2008 is going to be awesome.
