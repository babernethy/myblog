Looks like at least one announcement got out before the MIX’08 conference even started – and it is a big one.

I am eager to see how this plays out, but it looks like now software developed in Silverlight [will be able to run](http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=206901441#community) on Nokia Series 40 and S60 phones (which is [quite a few phones](http://www.s60.com/life/s60phones/browseDevices.do) by the way).

I’m not sure what (if any) subset of the features will be available on phones, and what type of Internet connectivity you can get, but the ability to now easily develop cellphone applications (on non-Microsoft OSes) is really cool.

So how do I get started?
