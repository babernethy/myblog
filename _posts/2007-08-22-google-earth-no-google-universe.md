*There was Google Earth, Moon, even Mars, now Google Universe. Now we just need a fancy Star Trekish LCARS interface… I guess if 95% of the world’s population has so much light pollution they can’t see the Milky Way in the night sky (or hardly even see the Little Dipper) this should help quite a bit (plus all the great deep sky details as well). – Bruce*

All right, this is the coolest thing ever. You know [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/), that cool software application that lets you explore satellite photography of the whole planet. Well, some clever Google engineers have flipped the software inside out, letting you explore the Universe with a similar interface.
