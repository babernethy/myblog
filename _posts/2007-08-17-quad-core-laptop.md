*I‚Äôll be the first to admit when I am wrong. There is a laptop (coming) with similar specs to my quad-core desktop. It even has 30% more disk space, and a second NVidia graphics card (I only have one). Sure it‚Äôll set you aside $10k, and a mini-fusion reactor to power while mobile, but it is ‚Äúpossible‚Äù. I could have 44-cores for that at home ‚Äì oooh mini super-computer grid üôÇ ‚Äì Bruce*

Not quite as groundbreaking as Wang Computers‚Äô word processor, XtremeNotebooks is offering the first Quad-Core Intel processors in laptops at a price of over $10,000 per unit fully stocked. The XTreme 917 has a Core 2 Quad Q6000 processor with dual NVidia processors and almost 1TB of hard drive space, which means that unless this has a car battery inside, you‚Äôll be looking at some dismal on-the-go use life. \[[XtremeNotebooks](http://www.xtremenotebooks.com/) via [PRNewswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/08-15-2007/0004646288&EDATE=) via [Wired](http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2007/08/first-quad-core.html)\]
