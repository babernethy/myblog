Having been working on Silverlight projects for years, there has really been no certification test to take as a credential, though I took the WPF 70-502 test as it was the closest technology to Silverlight that was available.  But even having been through the WPF test previously, and working in Silverlight for several years, there are still some details that are worth reviewing before you take the test.  If you are thinking about taking the test, here are some things that I found that were helpful in studying and passing the test.\r\n\r\np.s. Why might you want to take the test? First you can personally get a MCTS Silverlight (which is nice to have a current certification), also if you are a Microsoft Partner, this fulfills part of the Mobility Competency (along with the 70-599: Pro exam for WP7 - which is supposed to be out by now?), and most importantly, you gain depth - I always learn several things when studying for an exam which I am able to use fairly soon afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe Prometric/Microsoft testing agreement prohibits publishing actual test questions or summaries of the test itself, so I really should have written this yesterday while I was still preparing. I will try to recall the info without sharing anything that would violate the NDA on the test.  Good resources to review:\r\n\r\n1) <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-506\">Microsoft\'s information</a> - this is a good review of the information and sections of the test\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Laying Out a User Interface (15%)</strong> - this is a section on laying out the UI, you should know the XAML for the elements mentioned - this is very \"core\" stuff, don\'t lose any points here</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Enhancing the User Interface (14%)</strong> - styles, templates (know the difference), transformations, animations, visual state - again, review the syntax and know what is required and optional</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Implementing Application Logic (16%)</strong> - handling events, services, background workers, dependency properties, and the SL 4 ICommand interface</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I was worried that doing so much MVVM would hurt in doing things \"old school\" on the test, but they did a good job of respecting the pattern without using any of the frameworks outside of stock SL4.</li>\r\n	<li>Also, make sure you are comfortable with setting up event handlers as class methods but also as statement lambdas (i.e.. the \" += (s, args) = &gt; { } \" syntax).</li>\r\n	<li>If you have to learn some anonymous .NET delegates/functions at the same time as writing the test, it could add some complexity.</li>\r\n	<li>I realized that I was using a lot of the shortcuts/helpers in Visual Studio 2010 and ReSharper to help implement dependency properties - which is fine for daily use - but make sure you know how to do it \"from scratch\" as well.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Working with Data (17%)</strong>  - formatting, data binding, value converters, data validation</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>formatting and data binding are fairly common, value converters (especially the annoying boolean-to-visibility converter) are fairly common, but are largely templated (review the templates),</li>\r\n	<li> and data validation is used but not as common.  The data validation, especially, got a lot of \"love\" in later versions of Silverlight - review this.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Interacting with a Host Platform (11%)</strong>  - printing, out-of-browser applications, isolated storage, HTML DOM interaction, clipboard, read/write files from the host.</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li> Do yourself a favor - set up a quick OOB SL4 application that reads a file from the computer, combines that info with text on the clipboard, and prints out the result from Silverlight - it won\'t take long and what you learn will be very helpful (and useful).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Structuring Applications (13%)</strong> - I lost a question here somewhere - probably in the \"localization\" area (I\'ve never done that in production).  Review how to write and merge resource dictionaries, localize/globalize and application, and handle application-level events.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Deploying Applications (13%)</strong> - review the HTML &lt;object&gt; code structure, initparms, etc. how to dynamically load resources (zip file, fonts, etc.) and use what you find, and the client-access policy file (where does it go, what should be in it, etc.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div>2) Preparation Materials - nada, there are no online learning, books or practice tests that I could find yet - by the time these get out we\'ll be at Silverlight 5 - bummer</div>\r\n<div>3) The guys at Silverlight Show did a g<a href=\"http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/Getting-ready-for-the-exams-Part-1.aspx\">ood 7-part blog series</a> on preparing for the test - this was quite helpful to review.  They have been going over a prep guide for 70-599 (WP7) test as well which I plan to read and take soon.</div>\r\n<div>I am debating my next test, but I do have a summer goal of taking one more - probably WCF to fill out the MCPD certification.  Anyone who is interested in the WCF or WP7 tests, that wants to study together (online or in person), let me know in the next couple weeks.</div>','Silverlight Certification Test - Passed','','publish','open','open','','silverlight-certification-test-passed','','','2011-07-12 15:33:54','2011-07-12

a goal to get my blog up and running again by the end of June – so I figured I’d get a head start today <img class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile\" style=\"border-style: none;\" src=\"http://www.agileeducation.net/myblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/wlEmoticon-smile.png\" alt=\"Smile\" />\r\n\r\nI’ve been away from blogging for a while – first because of a major technical snafu at my previous hosting provider (WebHost4Life – ironic name), but then because of my lack of time and focus regarding blog posts.  Recently there has been so much going on and nowhere to blog, so I decided to start blogging again.\r\n\r\nI’ve opted for WordPress this time mainly for two reasons: 1) the previously mentioned “time factor” – WordPress is a two-click install and will automatically update itself when new versions come out (as 3.1.4 did today to handle some security issues), and 2) there are a bunch of really powerful (and mostly free) plugins and themes than those available in the BlogEngine.NET community.  I still operate a few BlogEngine.NET blogs for groups and clients, and where tighter control and easy customization is needed I’ll still go to BlogEngine for that (they have a shiny new version too).  But for my personal blog I am going with WordPress so I can (hopefully) focus more on the content and less on keeping things up to date and up and running.\r\n\r\n<strong>UPDATE:</strong>\r\n\r\nThe migration is going well – first major hurdles are taken care of.\r\n\r\nI have really liked Windows Live Writer as a blogging platform so I wanted to try to continue using that with WordPress.  Got that set up and posted some initial posts for testing – worked well.\r\n\r\nFound a helpful resource here: <a href=\"http://merill.net/2009/01/migrating-from-blogenginenet-to-wordpress/\">http://merill.net/2009/01/migrating-from-blogenginenet-to-wordpress/</a> which covers the major points in migration from BlogEngine.NET to WordPress.\r\n\r\n#1 Exporting the old blog posts\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Exported using the BlogML format, from the settings in the admin of BlogEngine.NET</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n#2 Find/replace the image tags\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Moving image links from the .axd in BlogEngine.NET to the wp-content/uploads directory</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n#3 Importing the BlogML into WordPress\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/blogml-importer/\">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/blogml-importer/</a></li>\r\n	<li>This crashed midway through the process so I need to find out if there are any missing posts – but the results do look pretty good.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n#4 Finding the missing images – my “backup” from WebHost4Life doesn’t look like it has all the images.  I am going to try to track them down on the backup drive and home computer – recreate or remove any I can’t find\r\n\r\nOverall pretty seamless – more content soon.\r\n\r\n<strong>UPDATE 2:</strong>\r\n\r\nMissed this the first time through:  The blog categories come over from BlogEngine in the BlogML as the long GUIDs (e.g. 74d4ef66-f7ce-4f9f-9286-b32b8e294a4a) what we really want is the human-readable name (e.g. Development).   The easiest way to fix this (looks weird to users and writers otherwise) is to import as normal, and then edit each Category in WordPress.  Copy the GUID and then search the BlogML for the code.  There will be a code element something like this …\r\n<pre class=\"csharpcode\">    <span class=\"kwrd\">&lt;</span><span class=\"html\">category</span> <span class=\"attr\">id</span><span class=\"kwrd\">=\"74d4ef66-f7ce-4f9f-9286-b32b8e294a4a\"</span> <span class=\"attr\">date-created</span><span class=\"kwrd\">=\"0001-01-01T00:00:00\"</span> <span

href=\"http://www.calvin.edu/academic/engl/festival/\">Festival of Faith and Writing</a> which is a conference for authors, playwrights, publishers, readers, teachers, etc.  I’ve been going to the conference since 1996, which was three years after I wrote my last/only book, but was right in the middle of the nine years I was writing monthly articles on technology in education.  So if it has been four years now since I have written anything (for money), why keep going to the conference?\r\n\r\nThe short answer is that I always learn something new, and always am reminded of things I had learned before but have forgotten (or stopped paying attention to).  I think all creative people who are working in their chosen craft share a lot of the same struggles.  These craftsmen can learn a lot from each other, whether they be authors, film makers, musicians, artists, or even people trying to create a good user interface or user experience using web sites and computer software.\r\n\r\nSo briefly below is my “Top 10+” list of things I learned or relearned this year.  Each of these items is probably a blog post or book in itself, but I don’t have time for that right now – perhaps I’ll expand on some of these in the near future.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Nothing replaces experience when conceiving and starting a project</li>\r\n 	<li>No craftsman (or woman) is an island</li>\r\n 	<li>A picture is still worth a thousand words</li>\r\n 	<li>Nothing is more inspiring than a talented craftsman with passion</li>\r\n 	<li>Give your audience something that they recognize, even/especially in brand new creations</li>\r\n 	<li>The best way to learn how to create something yourself is to regularly view/review other people’s creations</li>\r\n 	<li>Another great way to learn to to create something is to just get started creating something</li>\r\n 	<li>Spending only time with the “latest stuff” makes you “a mile wide, but an inch deep”</li>\r\n 	<li>Even the “masters” of any craft, if they are honest, will tell you of their daily struggles and fears</li>\r\n 	<li>“Process Versus Product” is a key concern for every craftsman</li>\r\n 	<li>“Picturing the Invisible” is another difficult and important skill to learn</li>\r\n 	<li>A true craftsman will be satisfied with a work well done, no matter if the audience is 2, 10, 100 or thousands of people</li>\r\n 	<li>A large motivation of craftsmen of all kinds is the puzzle, mystery or problem to be solved</li>\r\n</ul>','Lessons Learned: Craftsmen and artists of all types have a lot in

friends and family are non-programmers.  When a group of us get together “in real life” and I do find someone to talk technology with, we usually get the look of “oh they’ve gone off into the fantasy world of acronyms again, give them some space.”  I even slipped with my kids this weekend and mentioned something like “oooh, this week Visual Studio 2010 and Silverlight 4 come out!!”, and they politely asked what that was and why I was acting something like a kid at Christmas. So here is the short answer.\r\n\r\nEvery so often, programmers get an update of either their programming language, or their programming tools, or in this case BOTH.  While programming can be quite technical, it is still largely a creative process.  When writing new code you are creating something that did not exist before.  Usually you are creating this new thing for a customer or a group of people who need it or want it to improve their business or organization.  Software people sometimes use roles and titles from other crafts to describe what they do; some of us are “architects” or “engineers”.  When working with Silverlight we use all kinds of terms from artists like Canvas, Pens, Brushes, Strokes, etc.\r\n\r\nSo imagine you were in another creative craft such as painting.  And every so often you not only got a fresh set of brushes, but you also got some new brushes that you never had before, that enabled new strokes and techniques on your new canvases.  And a little less often you actually get new paints and even new colors that you never had before.  When the perfect storm happens and you get new tools, canvases, paint, colors, and more, this is a very exciting time.  This is a bit dramatic, but close to how I feel, especially when I am involved with a new project that actually needs some of these new tools and colors for what we are trying to do.\r\n<h3>What are some of the new “tools and colors” in VS2010?</h3>\r\nWell two big things are the ability to develop custom applications for both Windows 7 and Windows Phone 7 – Windows 7 has been out for a while and now programmers can take full advantage of a lot of the new features of Windows 7.  Windows Phone 7 will be out this fall and it basically a re-launch of the mobile phone platform for Microsoft.  No one knows how well Windows Phone 7 will compete with the iPhone and the Android phones, but the new features are very compelling and it should be fun to see what we can build for the new phones.\r\n\r\n<img style=\"margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline; border: 0px;\" title=\"silverlight-logo\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/silverlight-logo.jpg\" alt=\"silverlight-logo\" width=\"123\" height=\"123\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" /> But the main thing that I’ve been looking forward to is Silverlight 4 and its integration with VS2010. Developing in Silverlight with Visual Studio 2008 has been possible and productive, but going along with the painting analogy here, it has kind of been like “fingerpainting” compared to other kinds of development.  Now in VS2010, there is a full designer built in so you can preview and edit how Silverlight applications look and function right in the tool – this is nice.  It is also now much easier to change the style of an entire application so all the text, graphics, data input, etc. all look and work the same.  A big thing for me is enhancements to how animations and digital video can be streamed and manipulated in Silverlight.  Far beyond a simple video player with “VCR” controls, we can now do things with video that could never be done before. There are a ton more new features and possibilities coming out, but you get the picture.\r\n\r\nSo, in a nutshell, by Wednesday I will be actively using a bunch of new tools, brushes, and colors that I don’t have today (for production use) and be able to release applications that anyone on the Internet can use, which is why I am a little excited right now.','Why I make a fuss over the release of Visual Studio 2010','','publish','open','open','','why-i-make-a-fuss-over-the-release-of-visual-studio-2010','','','2011-07-05 21:41:23','2011-07-06 01:41:23','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Why-I-make-a-fuss-over-the-release-of-Visual-Studio-2010.aspx',0,'post','',35),(11,2,'2010-04-05 05:11:56','2010-04-05 05:11:56','<p>I headed over to the Apple Store over lunch to see the new iPad, and I was really happy they had about 12 of them out for people to try out.&#160; I did not become an iPad owner, though it would be very tempting if I didn’t have to pay off my surgery (could actually buy one for the entire family for that deductible) – the point is, it is a very nice device.&#160; For Apple to further be able to put all of this functionality into a $499 starting price, is a nothing short of a milestone.</p>  <p>The iPad looks great from a short distance – the cool glass edge-to-edge cover over black with the shiny silver undercarriage.&#160; I got to try out the only open device as people were really swarming around them, even at 11:20am a few days after launch.&#160; It really did remind me of my iPod Touch, though it made that device seem quite inadequate in a number of ways.&#160; The screen is much bigger, the processor is noticeably quicker, and the colors seem brighter (though that might have been just the size of the screen again).</p>  <p>So every application on your iPod Touch or iPhone that you ever wanted to be “bigger” works so much better.&#160; Reading is so much better on the big screen, especially if you are needing bigger type sizes these days.&#160; Watching a movie on the screen is quite impressive.&#160; I fired up the “Plants vs. Zombies” game, and the detail is much better and the interface makes it actually easier and more enjoyable to play.&#160; And games like Scrabble – where you want to play with a friend – is much easier for both to view on the larger screen.</p>  <h2>Things that were just too hard to reasonably do on a small screen:</h2>  <ul>   <li>Reading books or magazines (i.e. more than a few pages at a time)</li>    <li>Games of any complexity (e.g. board/war games, real-time strategy games, etc.) </li>    <li>Productivity Apps (e.g. word processing, spreadsheets, etc.) </li>    <li>Watching a full-length movie (and really enjoying it) </li> </ul>  <h2>Things that are still just fine on a small screen</h2>  <ul>   <li>Music </li>    <li>E-mail (reading, writing short messages). </li>    <li>Handheld games – e.g. Gameboy / Nintendo DS class games </li>    <li>Mapping / GPS </li>    <li>Twitter / Facebook </li>    <li>News </li> </ul>  <h2>New classes of apps made possible by the iPad / Tablets</h2>  <ul>   <li>Multimedia/Interactive publications – not just moving print and pictures to the web, but interlacing video and interactive components into the publications as well (Flash and Silverlight would sure be nice here – see below).&#160; This would include “textbooks” that are so much more than textbooks; Imagine the ability to watch a key scene from a Shakespeare drama included within the text itself, or a live physics simulation embedded in the chapter on Newtonian forces.</li>    <li>Mobile sales/presentations – this is the perfect type of device for sales people and others that do presentations to take on the road.&#160; It works well in 1-on-1 or small group situations to host the content itself, and can be hooked up to a projector for larger audiences.</li> </ul>  <h2>The iPad’s issues to resolve</h2>  <ul>   <li>Even with the iPad’s ancestors in the iPhone and iPod Touch, it is still a “1.0” device.&#160; There are <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/193434/ipad_fail_users_experiencing_issues.html\">already reports</a> of issues with WiFi reception and charging via the USB connection.&#160; Apple has been very good in the past at working with people to resolve issues and updating the hardware in future releases.&#160; And with 3/4 of a million of these devices already out there, I am sure they will get a lot of feedback.</li>    <li>While the 9.7” beautiful glass screen is its #1 feature it is also potentially the iPad’s #1 problem.&#160; How do you keep it from scratching when there is no cover?&#160; If it is in a backpack or bag with other things it’ll get scratchy pretty quickly.&#160; Along with added size is added mass.&#160; If this thing falls off a table and hits one of the edges (even on carpet) I think you will start to see some cracked or shattered devices.&#160; I don’t know if this is repairable or if it needs to be replaced.&#160; In my mind I see some kind of leather flap or cover (like an executive leather folder) with perhaps a clasp or zipper to protect the device in transit.&#160; The iPhone still fits nicely in a pocket or holster and I think that becomes a selling point now over the iPad. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: Search found that they have thought of this <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC361ZM/A\">$40 case with some protection here</a>.&#160; This will be available in Late April.&#160; Good.</li>    <li>Battery life.&#160; I know my iPod Touch after a couple years of solid use now needs to be recharged at least once a day.&#160; I don’t know how long the 9-10 hours of battery life will be true for the iPad.</li>    <li>Customer choice for applications and content.&#160; </li>    <ul>     <li>The irony of how nice the version of the “Plants vs. Zombies” game is on the iPad, is that it was finally getting back some of the functionality of the “original” Flash version – yes, this is a game that started on the web with Flash but was simplified for the smaller iPhone screen, and is now “enhanced” by bringing back some of the features of the Flash version.&#160; PvZ is one of thousands of popular Flash games that are out on the web that are inaccessible to all iPad users.&#160; Most interactive educational materials were developed in Director/Authorware/Flash and are also inaccessible on the iPad.&#160; </li>      <li>Further I can’t pick something as basic as a browser on the iPad.&#160; In daily use I use Chrome and Internet Explorer as my two main browsers – neither of these (nor Firefox, Opera, etc.) are allowed on the iPad because they would compete with the Safari browser from Apple.&#160; I am sure they will do the same thing to “protect” the profits from their productivity software and other utilities.</li>   </ul>    <li>No built-in camera?&#160; Need to figure that one out – maybe it put them over that $499 target price?</li>    <li>No GPS in the WiFi models?&#160;

I have even seen some speakers that seem to be just speaking for themselves and do not seem to be aware or care that there are any other people in the room.  I am not alone in these observations.\r\n\r\nAlso, I’ll stop short of saying that “PowerPoint is Evil!” but I will say that it is a tool that has been used much more often as a crutch for bad speech preparation, or as a smoke screen for a clear lack of content, than to support presentations of substance.  Even people that have gotten the whole “<a href=\"http://www.presentationzen.com/\">Presentation Zen</a>” idea seem to work harder on trying to find the right catchy picture for their content (or worse yet, catchy content for a cool picture they found).\r\n\r\nEven if you have had similar experiences with such presentations, I need to say that the audience is also somewhat at fault.  I have reviewed many evaluation forms from people at the events we have held or my own talks. The feedback always seems to be quite minimal and almost always “4-5 stars.”  I don’t know if this is because most of the talks are free or given by volunteers, or if the bar has been set fairly low.  There is an occasional “gem” of an evaluation, with some constructive criticism or suggestions for additions/improvement, and those are really “gold” to someone who takes their speaking seriously. One of the biggest things I have learned in my first month in Toastmasters is really how to evaluate and give feedback to speakers that they can use and work with.\r\n\r\nI’ll be the first to stand up and testify that I need help being a better speaker.  I have always gone over on time in my recent presentations – or at least cut out content that I had “intended” to get to.  I always thought it was better to have a lot of content that covered a variety of areas.  I have used and abused PowerPoint.  Because I try to squeeze an over-abundance of content into talks I tend to talk very quickly, which can be entertaining and engaging, but is not optimal for learning.  I admit I have sometimes finished or “tweaked” demos for a talk while setting up in the very room for the talk – again, keeps things “current” and “exciting” but doesn’t always show a concern for the content or audience.  I want to improve.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/ti_logo1.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; display: inline; border: 0px;\" title=\"ti_logo1\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/ti_logo1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"ti_logo1\" width=\"150\" height=\"133\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" /></a> So I enter into this Toastmasters experience with the intent to become more precise and concise in my speaking.  When I was first writing a monthly column I would write 1,200 or even 1,400 word articles only to have my ever-patient editor send them back and say to cut them down to 400-600 words but still “tell the same story.”   Over the years I got better at writing within the boundaries of a print publication and even avoided many edits in my last few years of writing.  I need to do the same thing with speaking – say less words but tell the same story.\r\n\r\nEach Toastmasters Club needs to recruit 20 members to be formally established, and the group is almost half way there.  I hope if you are a local “techie” that you are interested in improving your speaking skills, that you would consider stopping by on Monday over lunch as an “honored guest” at one of our meetings.\r\n\r\nFeel free to check out our <a href=\"http://tmfortechies.freetoasthost.org/\">web site</a> or our <a href=\"http://twitter.com/toast4tech\">Twitter account</a> for more info.','Toastmasters for Techies','','publish','open','open','','toastmasters-for-techies','','','2011-07-05 21:43:50','2011-07-06 01:43:50','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Toastmasters-for-Techies.aspx',0,'post','',42),(223,2,'2011-07-05 21:44:54','2011-07-06 01:44:54','<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/Toastmasters.png\">\n</a>About a month ago I started attending a new group forming now in Grand Rapids called “ <a href=\"http://tmfortechies.freetoasthost.org/\">Toastmasters for Techies</a>”.  I had heard of “Toastmasters” many times in the past as a group that had been around for a long long time to help people get better at speaking in public.  Today in 2010, Toastmasters has served over four million people and is growing all the time – case in point being this “Toastmasters for Techies” group.\n\nWhat drew me to this group was that is was:\n<ol>\n	<li>just getting started (didn’t want to be “behind”)</li>\n	<li>“unbranded” (some groups are part of businesses or organizations that I am not a part of)</li>\n	<li>local / close (meets downtown at Wealthy/Diamond at <a href=\"http://www.atomicobject.com/pages/Find+Us\">Atomic Object</a>)</li>\n	<li>focused on techies (not just “nerds” getting together and giving speeches, but better yet “geeks” getting together and giving speeches)</li>\n	<li>and I knew a few of the people who were already going and knew they were good people</li>\n</ol>\nIf you know me you know I like to talk – probably too much, and probably too often.  I gave professional presentations seven times last year, and five times each of the previous two years.  I’ve also led a Robotics club with a bunch of kids and parents, been a Den Leader in Cub Scouts, taught classes at church, and spend quite a bit of time at work talking/discussing/debating ideas and projects with clients and team members.  And all of this just means I am really part of the problem that Toastmasters is trying to solve.\n\nIf we are being honest right now, there are a lot of just-plain-bad-presentations out there in the computer field.  Either a presenter is just too smart for the audience and loses them in the first five minutes, or they get caught up in a failed demo that was the basis of their entire session, or they are a good speaker but it is clear that “someone else” prepared the slides and the demos for them, or some unfortunate combination of these which we won’t talk about.

A child really only need to know their colors and a few shapes to play; this is both a good and a bad thing.</p>  <p>It is good that parents and kids play Candyland together because it is a way to spend time interacting and having fun together.&#160; But Candyland is not a great game to get kids started on because it really needs no thought, creativity or strategy whatsoever. If you think about it, once you pick a game piece and shuffle the deck, the entire game is already determined.&#160; No matter how “good” you are at Candyland it doesn’t matter – you will will the same amount of games (over time).&#160; There are no “Candyland Tournaments” or “Candyland World Championships.”&#160; There are no books or web sites you can visit to discuss Candyland “strategy” with other players.&#160; You can never been any “better” at playing Candyland, and you can certainly never get any worse. Candyland is a colorful and fun “game” you can play with pre-school kids and have a great time, but it quickly loses its appeal once you realize that it is basically a “coin flip” and that even “rock-paper-scissors” has far more strategic value.&#160; Still don’t believe me.&#160; Imagine playing “solitaire Candyland” with two teddy bears and realize you now have a 66% chance of losing to a stuffed animal.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/LCR.jpg\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"LCR\" border=\"0\" alt=\"LCR\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/LCR_thumb.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"71\" /></a>Jump ahead a bunch of years and we got the “wildly popular and exciting LCR” game that “everyone is playing&quot; – and yes I was one of the suckers that dropped ~$5 on this “game in a tube.”&#160; If you haven’t played this game, it is pretty simple.&#160; You have 3 dice and a bunch of mini poker chips which are divided up among all the players.&#160; You roll the dice and will get either an “L” a “C” an “R” or a “*” (dot).&#160; If you get a dot (there are three per dice) then you do nothing.&#160; An “L” means pass a chip to the person on your left, an “R” means pass a chip to the person on your right, and a “C” means pass a chip to the center “pot” which grows as the game progresses.&#160; Once everyone is out of chips except one person, then the game is over.&#160; As you probably have figured out already, this is basically Candyland with dice.&#160; Sit down with the same two teddy bears as above and you will lose far more than you win.&#160; This isn’t to say you can’t have fun playing LCR – I’ve had a lot of fun playing Candyland and LCR – but the fun is more about the people you are spending the time with than the “game” itself.&#160; Some of the recommendations I have read for making LCR more fun often include substituting money or M&amp;Ms for the chips or adding a drinking component.&#160; By the way, if you don’t tell anyone else you can play “LCR” right now at home with three 6-sided dice and some pretzels: 1=L, 2=C, 3=R, 4-6 do nothing – saving you $5 and some frustration.</p>  <p>There was a posting on Board Game Geek called the <a href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/433105/comprehensive-lcr-strategy-guide\">“Comprehensive LCR Strategy Guide”</a> which is a very creative and funny read.&#160; Some “strategies” for playing LCR include “Throwing Off Your Opponents” and even “Cheating”.&#160; And beyond the humor this got me to thinking.&#160; When people get into what they consider to be a “no win” situation or even one where their “fate has already been determined” many are not content to just sit by and watch.&#160; If the rules aren’t fair – change the rules (bonus points if your just thought <a href=\"http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru_scenario\">Kobayashi Maru</a>).&#160; If you can’t change the rules – make your own rules (i.e. cheat).&#160; What if you could take a game like Candyland and LCR and find a way to give a particular player a better chance of winning than other players – say in a game with four players, what if the players had these chances to win: 20% 20% 20% 40% (i.e. the last person is twice as likely to win as any of the other players).&#160; This, clearly, wouldn’t be fair and most people would call this cheating.&#160; What if it wasn’t cheating, but right in the rules and what if all you had to do to get a better chance of winning was to pay some extra money.&#160; If you pay $20 extra dollars then you get to play with a different deck when you play Candyland – a deck that has better cards, no traps, and more doubles.&#160; What if LCR had a more expensive “expert” version that let certain players use dice that had better odds than other people – again not fair. But this is exactly how most games on Facebook work.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/warstorm.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"warstorm\" border=\"0\" alt=\"warstorm\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/warstorm_thumb.png\" width=\"244\" height=\"78\" /></a> Enter Warstorm.&#160; I’ve spent several hours over the last week playing Warstorm on Facebook, or more accurately watching Warstorm play itself in front of me. A couple family and friends started playing it and were talking about it, and you know I like a good game.&#160; On the surface Warstorm is very compelling and well designed.&#160; The application itself is visually stunning, the art is professional, the application programming and design is cutting-edge, and there are a great number of people playing it.&#160; But, if you really break it down, it is really a beautifully drawn, interactive, action-packed, implementation of “Candyland” but with “cheating” built in if you want to pay for it.</p>  <p>Without going too deep into the game itself, suffice it to say that all players of Warstrom start with the same limited collection of cards that they build up squads or armies of infantry, cavalry, archers, and many others to fight against one another.&#160; Each card takes a certain number of turns to come into the battle (bigger/more powerful cards take longer) and have different strengths and weaknesses.&#160; This initially sounds like Pokemon or Magic The Gathering – but it really isn’t, for a couple of really important reasons.&#160; In Pokemon and MTG the players actually get to play the game – in Warstrom you take your squad(s) and the computer plays the game in front of you.&#160; In fact, when you press “Ready” it could just tell you who won without all of the fancy battle graphics and animations; the computer already knows who won.&#160; As soon as the cards are “shuffled” the outcome of the game is set – just like Candyland.</p>  <p>However, unlike Candyland you can improve your odds of winning if you have some money to spend (or a whole lot of time on your hands).&#160; Here is a quick example – two different versions of two different cards.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/wsCards.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px\" title=\"wsCards\" border=\"0\" alt=\"wsCards\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/wsCards_thumb.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"174\" /></a> </p>  <p>The important thing to notice in this example is that these cards are identical except for the little number in the bottom left-hand corner – this is the number of turns it takes for these cards to come into play.&#160; So the first “Barbarian Warrior” will come in after 8 turns, but his otherwise-identical counterpart will come in 2 turns earlier.&#160; In Warstrom timing is everything.&#160; If two people built decks where one used the “8” cards and one used the “6” cards they would have a 25% better chance of winning each battle.&#160; The second two cards are even more extreme as the one card has a 50% speed advantage over the other one.&#160; And how do you get the “better” version of the cards, pay real cash money for them, or play a lot (seriously a lot).</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/wsBeast.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"wsBeast\" border=\"0\" alt=\"wsBeast\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/wsBeast_thumb.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"177\" /></a>One more example to show how far this can go – in the bottom right of these cards there is the attack power and toughness (how much damage they can take).&#160; The power/attack is what is important to beat the opponents army.&#160; You want powerful cards out quickly.&#160; The first card in this example is a 3/1 that comes out in 1 turn – so on the second turn this one is already attacking for 3 damage.&#160; This is an “Expert” card which means each pack of cards “costs” you 12500 silver (3-4 days of playing) or 5 gold ($1 cash = 4 gold).&#160; And this only gives you one chance of getting this card – there are many hundreds of different cards.&#160; The best an “average” can do to get a 3 power card is to hope for an “Aanden Silverback”.&#160; They are more common, but take 8 turns to come out – so the Golem that came out on turn 2 can kill the Silverback that comes out on turn 9 (or turn 7 if you pay more money).&#160; If this isn’t bad enough, the Golem is “Animated” which means that even if your turn 9 Silverback kills the Golem he has a 50% chance of coming back into play one turn later.&#160; Crazy.</p>  <p>Any game where the person who spends the most money wins just isn’t fair, and any game that just “plays itself” gets frustrating or boring very quickly.&#160; So, while it took me a good week to realize that Warstrom was unfair and frustrating, at least I did and I am out.&#160; Sorry guys.</p>  <p>But I won’t leave this on a down note.&#160; Instead of Candyland, LCR, and Warstrom let me recommend three real games that fit the same need but are fun, use your creativity, and have a good combination of luck and strategy. </p>  <p><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px\" title=\"conclusion\" border=\"0\" alt=\"conclusion\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/conclusion.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"132\" /> </p>  <p>With kids, instead of Candyland, try Checkers – with friends, play a simple card game like Rummy instead of LCR – and if you like the collectible card construction type of game, you can’t go wrong with Dominion.&#160; Remember, after playing a good game will have you thinking about what you could have done differently, and what you want to try the next time you play, these three will do that.</p>','Candyland, LCR, and Warstorm','','publish','open','open','','candyland-lcr-and-warstorm','','','2010-03-19 06:10:58','2010-03-19 06:10:58','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Candyland-LCR-and-Warstorm.aspx',0,'post','',35),(14,2,'2010-03-12 03:38:37','2010-03-12 03:38:37','<p><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px;

Who doesn\'t want to eliminate their fears, master emotions, release creativity and even &quot;reinvent your entire life&quot;. What follows in the book are some interesting ideas and tools for dealing with your inner self, but unfortunately it falls short of being that one book that will solve all the problems of life.&#160; Overall I’d give it 2-3 stars, and while some chapters were quite good and helpful to many, I would not make it a general recommendation to friends.</p>  <p>The book goes through Cury\'s twelve principles for &quot;thinking correctly&quot; most of which are very helpful and reflect time-tested practices like setting goals, making good choices, knowing your limits, working through failure, taking personal control of your own life, staying positive, focusing on the present, and not acting rashly by letting emotions control your life.</p>  <p>The first chapter &quot;Being the author of your own story I really liked because it does take a different tack on looking at your life from the outside and realizing that you are the author and director of what is going on in your life and inasmuch as you are willing to act to write the script and make the necessary changes in your life, you can radically impact the action and the plot in your story.</p>  <p>In the second chapter, Cury introduces his &quot;DCD&quot; technique for managing thoughts - that is, Doubt, Criticize, and Determine which will be mentioned throughout the book. In a nutshell this is the idea of monitoring your thoughts and picking off those that are negative or disturbing. Those negative thoughts should be challenged an analyzed critically and used for positive change or turned into something more helpful.</p>  <p>Where things started getting murky for me was later when Curry talked about &quot;Protecting Your Memory&quot; and even altering your memory. Curry continues to attempt to draw examples from the life of Jesus to support his principles. And in the memory chapter goes as far as to say that &quot;Judas\'s biggest mistake wasn\'t the betrayal of Jesus but his failure to learn transparency and realize that his greatest problems were within him.&quot; This does sound like what I might expect to hear from a psychologist, but statements like this led me to be more critical and guarded about the rest of the book.</p>  <p>Curry continues with guidance on being a better listener and being open to dialogue - and I am a big fan of dialogue versus debate. He continues these ideas, which do build on each other, to working on listening to and responding to the dialogue within you own mind. True listening and productive dialogue are very important and are something people work a lifetime to do well, so spending time thinking and practicing these skills in really key. </p>  <p>But then we move into &quot;contemplating beauty&quot; and are urged to &quot;allow everyday moments to become magical experiences&quot; which can occasionally be true, but not in many of my everyday moments. Curry encourages the reader to use &quot;Psycho-adaptation&quot; to turn ugly things into beautiful things, like turning the pain of the loss of a loved to a focus on &quot;new interests&quot;. Having been through some painful times, there is a time for mourning and grief where just &quot;thinking happy thoughts&quot; will not turn the loss into &quot;magical experiences&quot;. It is the inconsistency of Cury\'s ideas, from insightful to questionable, which prevent me from rating this book higher.</p>  <p>The chapter on Creativity seems rushed and out of sync with some of the others - there are much better coverage of Creativity in other entire books - and the chapter on being &quot;Restored in Your Sleep&quot; makes good points which would be key if a lack of sleep or troubled sleep were an issue in someone\'s life.</p>  <p>From my view Cury gets back on track with his chapter on living an &quot;Enterprising Lifestyle&quot; by outlining how to be looking for change, willingness to act on change and take a risk, accepting failure as well as success, and living live as an exciting adventure.</p>  <p>But he then goes off on a tangent with a very &quot;heady&quot; chapter on &quot;Thinking Existentially&quot; where he tries to tie together all ideas of identity, cosmology, and religion - with a stress that &quot;this book respects any form of belief, including atheism&quot; - but at the same time making a case for a &quot;God&quot;. The chapter floats between psychology, philosophy, theology, and never really &quot;lands&quot; in a way that makes it helpful to the reader. Again, this treatment of the topic further clouded my view of the chapters that really did seem to make sense and be helpful to me. </p>  <p>Overall the book was one that made me think and had some good insights, but it also caused doubts and made me critical of the content and author. </p> <a href=\"http://www.booksneeze.com/reviews/blogger/1386?ref=badge\"><img border=\"0\" alt=\"I review for BookSneeze\" src=\"http://www.booksneeze.com/images/booksneeze_badge.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" /></a>','Book Review: Think and Make It Happen','','publish','open','open','','book-review-think-and-make-it-happen','','','2010-03-12 03:38:37','2010-03-12 03:38:37','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Book-Review-Think-and-Make-It-Happen.aspx',0,'post','',36),(15,2,'2010-03-10 08:45:22','2010-03-10 08:45:22','<p>I tweeted earlier that I had now officially gone one month without fast food or drive thru, and that my goal is to keep this up.&#160; I “went public” with this achievement and goal for a couple reasons.&#160; The first is the most obvious, and selfish, reason – I need to put it out there so other people can hold me accountable for doing this and give me some well deserved ridicule should I slip back into the deep fryer.&#160; The other reason is kind of like the old joke: “Why did the chicken cross the road?&#160; To prove to the possum that is was possible.”&#160; That is to say, hopefully I can be an encouragement to others that it is possible to avoid the fast food traps and let people know that other people are trying to do this as well.</p>  <p>To be completely honest, while the “one month” statement is accurate it’ll be at least another week until this was a month of “conscious choice” on my part.&#160; You see three days of that month were in the hospital with a broken arm and three or four more days of that were at home recuperating. It was during these days at home, when I had my arm propped up on pillows on the big chair, that my wife just happened to turn on Netflix for me and choose to watch <img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 10px 10px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"supersizeme\" border=\"0\" alt=\"supersizeme\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/supersizeme.jpg\" width=\"170\" height=\"231\" /> “Super Size Me”.&#160; As I was basically a captive audience at this point I watched the whole show.&#160; I had watched part of it before – maybe even most of it – but it was really not at a “teachable moment” in my life as I was during this recovery period.</p>  <p>“Super Size Me”, if you haven’t seen it, is an irreverent review of the fast food industry and really the food industry as a whole.&#160; The premise is that Morgan Spurlock would eat only McDonalds food for breakfast, lunch and dinner for 30 days and see what impact this has on his health, mood, and life in general.&#160; Simple enough.</p>  <p>The “side plots” include vignettes on where the food comes from, how it is processed, what it is made out of, how the same food is now in many school cafeterias, and even in some hospitals.</p>  <p>While the methods of Spurlock would never be classified as “true science”, and there are many valid criticisms of his process and how he chose to carry it out, there are some plain facts that really can’t be refuted.&#160; </p>  <ul>   <li>The quality of fast food can not compare to that of food prepared at home</li>    <li>Fast food offers a quick burst of energy from sugar, other carbs, and fat, but at the price of a huge let down later on with even cravings for more of the same kind of food </li>    <li>The portion sizes at fast food restaurants vastly exceed the calories needed for a single meal – just look at the history of what a “large” pop/soda has been over the last 20 years as well as what a portion of french fries has been in the same time period.</li> </ul>  <h2>My Favorite Foods</h2>  <p><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"wendysbaconator\" border=\"0\" alt=\"wendysbaconator\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/wendysbaconator.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"179\" />My “fast food drug” of choice has often been Wendy’s because it is directly across the street from work, and I worked at Wendy’s in high school and learned to like their food.&#160; But even before I broke my arm I had some bad feelings building about Wendy’s.</p>  <p>In the last six months I have been troubled by their new “Baconator” line of sandwiches.&#160; There was a huge sign by the drive thru basically taunting you to get a huge double cheese burger with multiple layers of bacon.&#160; I never did try it – mainly because I really prefer their chicken sandwiches (having prepared the burgers at the aforementioned job) – but the idea that they were enlarging their burgers and adding multiple layers of bacon seemed to me that they were really headed in the wrong direction.</p>  <p><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"drivethrudiet\" border=\"0\" alt=\"drivethrudiet\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/drivethrudiet.png\" width=\"270\" height=\"117\" /> The other thing I had noticed is from my #2 Fast Food destination – Taco Bell.&#160; They started a new thing this year called the “Drive-Thru Diet Menu”.&#160; I never saw any commercials or explanations of this, but my first gut reaction to it was “this has to be a joke.”</p>  <p>I would never have put together Taco Bell and being on a diet.&#160; I guess they were trying to pull of something like Subway did with Jared several years ago, but that just doesn’t seem to work in my mind with Taco Bell.&#160; Taco Bell is cheap, tasty, and filling food – red meat, refried beans, and some token veggies inside an amazing variety of hard and soft shells.&#160; But it really wouldn’t fall into a diet that someone could follow.&#160; I could buy a “lighter side” menu or even a “more veggies” icon, but I couldn’t imagine someone eating nothing but Taco Bell.</p>  <h2>Local Shopping and Local Growing</h2>  <p><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"Local-First\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Local-First\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/Local-First.jpg\" width=\"175\" height=\"93\" />The final reason I think I was ready to step away from fast food was something that has really become important to me lately, and that is supporting local businesses and eating local foods.&#160; There are many reasons to shop locally and eat locally-grown foods.&#160; An obvious one is a financial reality in today’s Michigan economy – if I buy from a store owned by local owners and employing local workers, then much (even most) of the money circulates back into the local economy as they do business with other local businesses and contribute to local charities and non-profits, they employ local workers, and even profits go to local owners to invest in more local businesses.</p>  <p>Another big reason is potentially significant health benefits.&#160; When local restaurants buy their food from local farmers (and yes there are great local greenhouses in our area that grow produce all year long) then the food can be much more fresh than if it had to be imported from Southern America (or even South America).&#160; Big chains like fast food restaurants often centralize their distribution of food and even have a lot of it pre-processed before coming to the location (e.g. shredding lettuce, making meat patties, even pre-cooking some food) – as a test, just ask someone where their produce or meat comes from, if they don’t know then that should tell you something.&#160; It’s also much better for the environment for food to travel 10, 20, or 50 miles to your destination instead of crossing the globe.</p>  <p>Another thing you can do if you know where your food actually comes from is you can know what the growers and farmers actually do when they are growing the food or raising the chickens.&#160; Even if you aren’t looking for the food to be organic, it is nice to be able to know what fertilizers and pesticides are used.&#160; What kind of chickens are they (yes there are different breeds)?&#160; You can even, sometimes, go and visit the farms for educational purposes and peace of mind.&#160; You will also notice that some of the “staples” that you have used in the past just don’t grow anywhere locally, but that there are alternatives and different things that you should probably try. I am really looking forward to the local Farmer’s Markets to start up again this spring to see what else I might be missing.</p>  <h3></h3>  <h2>Is It Working?</h2>  <p>If I thought about this more I might actually journal my health, feelings and weight loss along the way this year.&#160; One month is not really enough to become a spokesperson or expert for this lifestyle.&#160; But that being said I will say this.&#160; I do generally feel much better while eating the lunch I brought with me, a home cooked meal, or even a soup and salad at Olive Garden instead of a sandwich and fries.&#160; Some people talk about the “food coma” you can feel after a large meal or a meal high in sugar, carbs and fat.&#160; These foods can hit your blood stream so quickly and your body reacts and tries to process (or store) the energy and you can get this feeling of just wanting to crash after eating.&#160; A smaller and lighter meal does not have the same impact – in fact, much the opposite.&#160; I don’t miss the food coma feeling and don’t miss any of the intestinal distress that I don’t need to really explain.</p>  <p>The other amazing thing I have noticed is that my recovery from my broken arm has been miraculously fast.&#160; I am only three weeks from major surgery with a big metal plate being put in my arm and my bicep muscle being torn and cut.&#160; Only one week ago I got my stapes out and my sling taken away.&#160; The amount of healing my body has done in this short time shocks and confuses a lot of people, and even myself.&#160; I have been taking some supplements of Calcium and Vitamin D and D3, but I have also been consuming many more vitamin rich vegetables, mostly raw, than I am used to and drastically reduced my meat and fat intake.&#160; And this is not because I am “on a diet” it is really because I am preparing and bringing my lunch and not visiting fast food establishments.&#160; I can’t directly correlate my rapid healing to eating differently, but I do believe it has been a big part of it.</p>  <p>This next month will be quite different as I expect to be mostly “back to normal” with my arm in a few weeks and the spring melt is enabling us to get outside a lot more.&#160; I still have 3-5 more months until the bone in my arm is healed, but the metal plate, while a drastic and significant surgery, has the benefit of enabling me to use the arm much sooner.</p>  <p>I’ll post again in a month or so, and do ask me about it if you see me.&#160; Some have asked if I could make healthy choices at a fast food place or eat the food in moderation – I don’t think so.&#160; This is probably more of a failing in myself than anything else.&#160; I am going to stick with the “zero fast food pledge” as it is easier for me to accomplish and easier for me to assess and be accountable for.&#160; I’ll need to add some activity and exercise measures in there as well at some point – let’s shoot for that a month from now.</p>','One Month of No Fast Food or Drive Thru','','publish','open','open','','one-month-of-no-fast-food-or-drive-thru','','','2010-03-10 08:45:22','2010-03-10 08:45:22','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/One-Month-of-No-Fast-Food-or-Drive-Thru.aspx',0,'post','',35),(16,2,'2010-03-10 00:29:01','2010-03-10 00:29:01','<p>If you know me or follow this blog at all you will probably know a few things about me: 1) I really like working with the latest technology and 2) I have a long history with Education and Learning.&#160; It just so happens that a project I am working on now, that is using some “cutting edge” technology, takes me back about 18 years to a project I worked on in the summer of 1992.&#160; I am talking about “hypervideo”, though in 2010 we are now doing it with streaming high-definition video instead of laserdisc recorders.</p>  <h2>What did “hypertext” do for “text” with HTML?</h2>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/samplehtml.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; margin: 10px 0px 5px 15px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"samplehtml\" border=\"0\" alt=\"samplehtml\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/samplehtml_thumb.png\" width=\"504\" height=\"156\" /></a> We are so used to hypertext and the world-wide web, that we really don’t think about the technology and features behind it any more, but let’s take a second to “review the obvious”.&#160; The hypertext-markup language (HTML) is the coding behind the world-wide web.&#160; It is used to take the raw text and put a structure around the text and within the text.&#160; What started as a simple text file now gains things like:</p>  <ul>   <li> a “title”, </li>    <li>“headings”, </li>    <li>“hyperlinks”,</li>    <li> navigation, </li>    <li>sections/anchors, </li>    <li>a unique identifier (uniform resource identifier (URI)), </li>    <li>and data-about-the-data or “metadata”.</li> </ul>  <p>Users of these pages never really see any of this information, but they do appreciate it and use it all the time.&#160; They can enter an address like <a href=\"http://www.nbcolympics.com\">www.nbcolympics.com</a> and be taken directly to the online Olympic coverage from NBC (and how little most people appreciate how easy this is for them to do now.&#160; Users can “bookmark” or “favorite” particular pages and get back to them whenever they want to.&#160; Better yet, they can use Google or Bing to type in a few words or a phrase and often find exactly what they are looking for.&#160; Search engines use the titles, headings, and metadata in the page in their search routines to find these pages.&#160; And let’s not forget those wonderful underlined blue hyperlinks and linked buttons on pages that allow us to jump from page to page, and often find great resources and pages that we never knew that we were even interested in.</p>  <p>The problem with non-text items on web pages is that it is hard for computers to figure out what they are – if you put a picture of your dog on a web page it is still very hard for a browser or search engine to “look” at the picture and file it under “dog.”&#160; With words you can often tell what they mean from the context of the words that precede it or follow it; so this helps.&#160; Today, images can contain an “alt” attribute where you can describe the picture in words.&#160; This was originally though to be for browsers that did not support images or for screen readers for visually impaired users of the web, but now serves very well to help identify images to search engines.</p>  <h2>What if we could do similar things for video?</h2>  <p>But what about video?&#160; Sites like YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo enabling the upload of tens of thousands of hours of video.&#160; Each video contains a title and description which helps enable search to find the video.&#160; But what about what is inside the video.&#160; A single video may have many distinct sections or chapters where information is presented logically.&#160; In each section there could be textual information describing what is going on in the video (think closed captioning or even the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_Video_Service\">Descriptive Video Service</a>).&#160; What if you could not only search to find the video, but also find a particular time-code within the video (e.g. where the bit of text you searched for occurred in the video)?&#160; What if you could embed hyperlinks to other videos, other timecodes, other pages or notes, etc. within the video itself, so that they would appear or become available at a particular time when the video was playing?</p>  <p>Well, we can.</p>  <h2>TUVA</h2>  <p>My favorite current example of hypervideo ideas is <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/apps/tools/tuva/\">Project TUVA</a> .&#160; For one, the main content is Dr. Richard Feynman’s wonderful physics lecture series at Cornell in the ‘60s (and who doesn’t like some good physics every so often).&#160; But, for me, it is also nice to know that it is built with Silverlight, which is a toolset that I am very aware of, so I know I could use many of these features myself down the road.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/tuva1.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"tuva1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"tuva1\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/tuva1_thumb.png\" width=\"420\" height=\"344\" /></a> </p>  <p>At the core of the player you will see something that looks very common for videos on the internet.&#160; There are the standard “VCR” controls, volume, and full-screen buttons – nothing really special so far.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/tuvadetails.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"tuvadetails\" border=\"0\" alt=\"tuvadetails\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/tuvadetails_thumb.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"339\" /></a> </p>  <p>But it doesn’t take long to see just how much else can be added to the video player when you start thinking about hypervideo concepts of linking, navigation, chapters, notes, and more.</p>  <h3>Chapters.</h3>  <p>The first thing I noticed about the player was the expanded navigation and information timeline on the very bottom (I would really encourage you to open this site if possible because experiencing this live will help you understand this much more than a few static images and my attempt to describe the interactions with words).&#160; Each of the seven videos in Feynman’s lecture series are broken up into logical “chapters” with chapter titles like “Newton” and “Electricity”.&#160; This provides much the same functionality of HTML headings and anchor tags.&#160; You can quickly see the structure of the video and jump to any chapter from this navigation bar.</p>  <h3>Notes / Expert Commentary</h3>  <p>Since this player was designed for an educational setting, the ability for the viewer to add their own notes in a left-side panel was added.&#160; This allows for anyone watching the video to add a note at a particular time in the video which they will be able to review later.&#160; In addition to this, you can load other people’s notes files and see what they were thinking during the video.&#160; This feature allows for the addition of “expert commentary” within the video frame – kind of like on a DVD where some allow you to turn on an audio track that includes the director and/or other people involved with the movie.&#160; This would also allow a teacher to include their own comments and instructions for students watching the video – and yes, these are also time-stamped so they can become clickable as well to add another layer of navigation.</p>  <h3>Closed Captioning / Transcript</h3>  <p>We’ve all seen closed-captioning on television shows where what is being said in a particular show is displayed on the screen for those who are hearing impaired or for situations where the ambient noise in a room is such that the television can’t be heard.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/tuvatranscript.png\"><img style=\"display: inline\" title=\"tuvatranscript\" alt=\"tuvatranscript\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/tuvatranscript_thumb.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"483\" /></a> </p>  <p>The “Tuva” interface takes closed-captioning one step further and turns it into a full transcript of the talk being given.&#160; You can literally read through all the different close captioning entries in a scrollable textbox.&#160; Not only can you read through the captioning, but each of the captions itself is now a hyperlink that will take you to the time in the video where that caption was on screen.</p>  <p>But wait.&#160; If we have all this text now, linked to the video, can’t we search this too?&#160; Yes.</p>  <h3>Search</h3>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/tuvasearch.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"tuvasearch\" border=\"0\" alt=\"tuvasearch\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/tuvasearch_thumb.png\" width=\"554\" height=\"456\" /></a> </p>  <p>The interactive search box in the “Tuva” interface will allow the user to search the transcripts of all of the chapters of all of the videos for a keyword or phrase.&#160; Then all of the “hits” can be displayed, and yes, they are clickable hyperlinks.</p>  <h3>Links / Extras</h3>  <p>The other notable feature of this interface is the “Extras” which are shown at the very bottom of the screen.&#160; Embedded into the video are bits of metadata which enable the inclusion of “notes” and “links” within the video itself.&#160; Each extra can have an associated icon or image which becomes visible in the “Extras” pane on the right at the appropriate time in the video.&#160; For a “note” type extra, this can pop-over a panel that includes extra information about a particular topic being discussed.&#160; The viewer can click on the icon to read this note, which pauses the video until they are done.&#160; Similarly clicking on a “link” extra will take the user to another part of the site or even off of the site to a page that explains a topic in more detail.&#160; For example, if Feynman is discussing Albert Einstein, and the viewer knows a lot about Einstein, then they can ignore the picture of Einstein in the Extras panel.&#160; If they are less familiar with Einstein, they can click on the icon and be taken to a new page that discusses the works and life of Einstein in detail.&#160; When they are ready, the viewer can close the page and return to the video which can then proceed from where they left off.</p>  <h2>NBC Olympics</h2>  <p>But how might this technology look in a less “academic” and non-research or prototype situation – how about the 2010 Winter Olympics?</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/nbco1.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px;

They created a nice “blue-ice” themed player with all the functions you would expect from a modern player.&#160; A Play/Pause button, Fast Forward, Rewind, Jump Back, Volume, Full-Screen, and even a humorous “Boss” button that filled your screen with a Windows 7 desktop with an open Excel spreadsheet – cute.</p>  <p>But if you look a little closer you will see some components are are not, yet, very typical of video players online.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/nbc02.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"nbc02\" border=\"0\" alt=\"nbc02\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/nbc02_thumb.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"385\" /></a> </p>  <p>Clicking on the “Key Events” button for this Snowboarding video pops-up a scrollable list of all of the heats within this pre-recorded event.&#160; So that if I scroll through the list and&#160; want to find the round with Nick Baumgartner from the USA, I can find him in Heat 8 – clicking on this item takes me directly to that time in the video.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/nbco3.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"nbco3\" border=\"0\" alt=\"nbco3\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/nbco3_thumb.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"151\" /></a> </p>  <p>Similarly, the time bar at the bottom of the player has small lines at particular times, that you might not even see if you weren’t looking for them.&#160; In this example I was trying to find the quarter-final with Wescott and Holland from the USA – clicking on that bookmark took me directly to that point.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/nbco4.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px;

This allows for you to see interesting details about each event as it occurs.&#160; For example here, we can see that the skier has achieved 54.7mph on the ramp before taking off – crazy.</p>  <h3>How is it Done?</h3>  <p>So, great, this is a cool technology and I’ve got a bunch of ideas on how it could be used.&#160;

We had gotten about an inch or two of new snow, but that is pretty normal.&nbsp; Unfortunately at the end of the driveway the snow was on top of some ice - but also, not that strange.&nbsp; With ice under snow, I got close to the garbage can when both feet flew out from under me at the same time, so I was going down - fast.&nbsp;

I decided to try to roll over and pick myself up.</p>\r\n<p>In my mind, both of my arms were above my head, but as I rolled over I saw my left arm sitting beside me - this is probably one of the weirdest sensations I have ever felt.&nbsp; My arm was were it was not \"supposed to be\" and when I told the hand to open and shut, it did, but it was very \"wrong\" and my arm was \"waggling\".&nbsp; Trying to move my arm was pointless as it was going whatever way it wanted to and hurt more than anything&nbsp; I can remember.</p>\r\n<p>This is a photo from Flickr - not mine - I don\'t have any but I will try to get some.&nbsp; This is also a woman\'s arm, but it comes closest on a short search to what I remember them showing me.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"/image.axd?picture=2010%2f2%2fhumerus_break.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>So the problem was my humerus bone was basically sheered in two and one of the broken sides was jabbed into my bicep muscle.</p>\r\n<p>Long story short; got to ER, x-rays, can\'t cast a transverse break, 24 hours later, 10\" steel plate attached with 7 screws on the bone having to tear some more muscle to attach the plate (but this should heal). Day and a half of recovery in the hospital and now I am home.</p>\r\n<p>Good news is my wrist and fingers are working very well considering.&nbsp; The break was within a half-inch of where the nerves attach to operate the upper arm - that could have been much worse.&nbsp; My tricep muscle is progressing and I can move my arm back and forth.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately my bicep will need some therapy and it may be months before it is back to function.&nbsp; I can\'t lift my arm right now and need a splint or a strap to move it around.</p>\r\n<p>I have a cool scar - about 10 inches long with 40 or so staples right now - looks like a bicep zipper without the zipper part.&nbsp;I will be going in in 10 days to have a follow up appointment and make plans for further therapy.</p>\r\n<p>There are more details, but they aren\'t as relevant (and kind of gross) and I am done with this first typing practice.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for all the prayers, notes and e-mails - they are a great encouragement.</p>','How I broke my arm and will now set off every metal detector','','publish','open','open','','how-i-broke-my-arm-and-will-now-set-off-every-metal-detector','','','2010-02-14 03:10:00','2010-02-14 03:10:00','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/My.aspx',0,'post','',22),(18,2,'2010-02-06 04:15:05','2010-02-06 04:15:05','<p>I am trying to spend the early hours of Saturday morning experimenting and learning about something that interests me, with the only requirement being that is has no immediate practical value other than learning (i.e. it is not linked to work or other side projects).&#160; If it seems interesting enough, I’ll blog it.&#160; This was fun.&#160; Also, this post will be much less technical than the last set, no programming needed for this one, in fact anyone with PowerPoint will be able to take advantage and use the tools here.&#160; There may be a follow on post that will be more technical, but I wanted to alternate between tech anyone can use, and tech that really only developers could appreciate.</p>  <p>Back on January 18th, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/shanselman\">Scott Hansleman</a> tweeted about the new <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/multipoint/mouse-sdk/default.aspx\">Windows MultiPoint Mouse SDK</a> by teasing “Want your application to support TWO mice at a time?”&#160; This is something I remember doing waaay back with the early Macintosh computers having multiple students with different mice interacting with a single HyperCard stack.&#160; Now we can do this again, in code wit, and with a cool PowerPoint plugin called “Mouse Mischief”.&#160; </p>  <p>Then on January 26th woot.com had $.99 refurbished mice for sale on a Woot-Off – why would anyone buy three mice that had been returned and refurbished?&#160; For just such an experiment.</p>  <p>Disclaimer: This is beta technology and should only be used by people who aren’t easily frustrated and don’t expect a final/polished result.&#160; This technology will be final soon – if you want it to be more tested and full-functioned, come back in a few months and try this out.</p>  <p>The Mouse Micschief PowerPoint 2007 plugin can be found on <a href=\"http://connect.microsoft.com\">Microsoft Connect</a>.&#160; You will need a Microsoft Live ID and register with Microsoft Connect.&#160; This is a great place to stay current on Microsoft technology and participate in beta programs.&#160; But, again, it is not for everyone.</p>  <p>Once installed, “Mouse Mischief” will show up as a PowerPoint ribbon control.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/mm1.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px;

Also note the “pptPlex” tab that is still up there.&#160; This is another cool PowerPoint plugin that makes your presentations use a “DeepZoom” look and feel which makes the very “Silverlighty”, but that is/was another post.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/mm2.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px;

If you insert the new slide types and play the slides the “normal” way in PowerPoint, there will be no new functionality in the slides.&#160; If you launch the slides using the play button in the ribbon you will get the multi-mouse functionality.</p>  <p><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"mm3\" border=\"0\" alt=\"mm3\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/mm3.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"298\" /> </p>  <p>When you first start your “Mischievous” presentation you will notice a slide you didn’t add yourself.&#160; This allows for one (or more) mice to “register” itself as the presenter/teacher (this specific tool is education oriented, but has many uses outside of education as well).&#160; If you move other mice at this point you will see multiple mice moving independently on the screen – very cool. Previous to this, if the different mice had been moved, they would all have controlled the single cursor on the screen.</p>  <p><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline;

show that the designers of this are expecting a massive number of different mice – perhaps a classroom full – we only have four (teacher/presenter and three for feedback).</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/mm5.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"mm5\" border=\"0\" alt=\"mm5\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/mm5_thumb.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"321\" /></a> </p>  <p>When we get to a screen that has one of the Yes/No or Multiple Choice questions, then the different mice become active and they get to pick one of the answers.&#160; When everyone has answered, or the teacher/presenter chooses to move on, we get a summary screen.</p>  <p><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"mm6\" border=\"0\" alt=\"mm6\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/mm6.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"312\" />&#160;</p>  <p>This provides instant feedback for presenters and/or checks for comprehension from the audience.&#160; The multiple choice slide has other options.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/mm7.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display:

<p>Notice that only the presenter/teacher mouse has the ability at the bottom to move the presentation to the next or previous slide, or to end the interaction early.&#160; In addition to giving feedback on open-ended questions like this one, you can also pre-pick the “correct” answer on the slide and show how many had the correct answer, and who was first to respond.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/mm9.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"mm9\" border=\"0\" alt=\"mm9\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/mm9_thumb.png\" width=\"238\" height=\"244\" /></a> </p>  <p>When the presentation is complete, you need to end the presentation with the presenter/teacher mouse (i.e. audience/class members can’t end or control the flow of the presentation.</p>  <p><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px;

once screen is great – and this “Mouse Mischief” plug-in tool for PowerPoint gets you started right away.</p>  <p>In Part 2 of this series, I will show how a developer can add multi-mouse support to their own applications using the MultiPoint Mouse SDK – if you want to get started early, check out the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/multipoint/mouse-sdk/developer.aspx\">MultiPoint Mouse SDK

href=\"http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/post/Silverlight-Kata-IFS-Fractals-The-MessageBus.aspx\">Part 3</a>, then you know we have described basically what the IFS Fractal “quest” is, how we did the rotatation/translation/scale transforms, and how we wired up the MessageBus to send our messages.</p>  <h2>Complete Code Solution</h2>  <p>So we are ready to put it all together: [ <a

the “fern” required”) and also gave me a place to put the foreground and background colors – which is nice.&#160; I added “Age” so I could tell how many iterations each object had gone through (surfaces as a ToolTip).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How well does it work?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Serpinski Triangle / Gasket, I was very pleased:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/triangle8it.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width:

iterations, we have a fine (nearly textbook) example of what we were looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the “Checkered ‘X’”, also very nice:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/cross5it.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"cross5it\" border=\"0\" alt=\"cross5it\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/cross5it_thumb.png\" width=\"420\" height=\"423\" /></a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>More predictable, in my opinion, than the triangle, but after only 5 iterations we have the multi-layered self-similar “X”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for the Barnsley Fern:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/fern7it.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"fern7it\" border=\"0\" alt=\"fern7it\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/fern7it_thumb.png\" width=\"260\" height=\"401\" /></a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not what I was hoping for.&#160; Even after 7 iterations (creating 16384 IFSContentControls), this is only starting to look like what I was hoping for.&#160; Iterating one more time left the browser “Not Responding” and was not generally a good idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fern has many intricate details that do not surface well with this algorithm.&#160; There are “bitmap” algorithms that create very nice ferns in a short amount of time (“classic” GDI+ routines) …</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/bitmapfern.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline;

src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/bitmapfern_thumb.png\" width=\"268\" height=\"504\" /></a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But these do not track each translation and each message going out, which was what I was hoping to learn about from this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the goal last weekend (which turned in to a goal to blog about it before “next” weekend (i.e. tomorrow)) was to learn more about TransformGroups and to see how much I could stress the EventAggregator/MessageBus without it caving.&#160; More about that in the last installment.</p>\r\n\r\n<li><a

application.&#160; What started with <a href=\"http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/post/Silverlight-Kata-IFS-Fractals-with-TransformGroup-and-MessageBus.aspx\">Part 1 </a>(intro to Fractals and the Silverlight experiment) and continued with <a href=\"http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/post/Silverlight-Kata-IFS-Fractals-Automating-the-Transforms.aspx\">Part 2</a> (creating the IFSContentControl) now gets a MessageBus to help communicate to and from the different controls</p>  <p>The EventAggregator and MessageBus patterns have been <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventAggregator.html\">described as a pattern</a> and&#160; <a href=\"http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageBus.html\">discussed for a while</a> and recently implemented by several different frameworks within Silverlight.&#160; The basic idea is to decouple messages for common functions from specific classes.&#160; If there is a common set of Messages, and a shared MessageBus, then objects with access to the bus and messages can “subscribe” to the messages that they want to “hear” and “publish” messages that they want to send out.</p>  <p>A more detailed description of this particular implementation <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms978583.aspx\">as described by the Microsoft Patterns &amp; Practices</a> group implemented as <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd458918.aspx\">EventAggregator</a>.&#160;&#160; We will use the EventAggregator for our MessageBus and CompositePresentationEvent from the Microsoft.Practices namespace described here.</p>  <h2>Which Messages?</h2>  <p>So, then, what are the messages that we will want to have in this application?</p>  <p>“Iterate” is the big and obvious one.&#160; We may, for example, want to press a Button and have it Publish the “Iterate” Message to the MessageBus.&#160; Then, we’ll want our IFSContentControls to Subscribe to the “Iterate” message and have them generate the next generation of the fractal.</p>  <p>So to start out we’d have this …</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/messagebus1.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"messagebus1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"messagebus1\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/messagebus1_thumb.png\" width=\"450\" height=\"122\" /></a></p>  <p>The IFSContentControl would clone itself and apply each transform (3 in this example).&#160; These new controls would then also Subscribe to the “Iterate” Message. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/messagebus2.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"messagebus2\" border=\"0\" alt=\"messagebus2\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/messagebus2_thumb.png\" width=\"450\" height=\"178\" /></a> </p>  <p>So the next click of the button that publishes the message will now be “heard” by three different objects ….</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/messagebus3.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"messagebus3\" border=\"0\" alt=\"messagebus3\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/messagebus3_thumb.png\" width=\"450\" height=\"308\" /></a> </p>  <p>And so on … and so on …</p>  <p>To fully make this work though, we’ll need to (1) get the new controls onto our Container/Canvas.&#160; And, in the case of these fractals, the original control does not “survive” the iteration and only “lives” through one generation.</p>  <p>So we’ll add two more Messages: (1) AddIFSControl (to add the new IFSControls to the Container) and (2) RemoveIFSControl (to remove the current control from the Container once the Iteration is complete).</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/messagebus4.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width:

DoIteration() will iterate through all the different transforms, create a new IFSControl which is a clone/copy of the current control, and then Publish the AddIFSControl message with the new control as the payload.&#160; In our example this will happen three times for each iteration, so three new controls will be sent in messages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last two lines are interesting as well.&#160; Once the new controls are created it is time for the current control to request that it be removed from the container – it has done its work and it is time to move on.&#160; First we Unsubscribe from the DoIteration Message (always good to not leave loose ends) and then Publish the RemoveIFSControl message with “this” as the payload (i.e., the current control). It is thus requesting to be removed from the container.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Container Messages</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In this example the DataContext of our MainPage will be a class called the IFSStageViewModel.&#160; This class encapsulates all the information and logic that will be needed for the user interface of our application.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;

The probability is for when the different transformations need to happen more or less often in order to create the desired shape. For example a tree may have many leaves, but less branches; a person may grow more hair than they grow in height.&#160; Many of the transforms will be “uniform” and have all the same probability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is nice that we can enter our transforms in this concise class, but it would also be nice if we could translate these numbers into a XAML TransformGroup like the ones we manually created in the last post.&#160; To do this we’ll add a public method to the IFSTransform to accomplish this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline;

Inspiration for this also came from Corey Hanes great feature summary of another classic, the “<a href=\"http://github.com/coreyhaines/practice_game_of_life\">Game of Life</a>”.\r\n\r\nThis post isn’t intended to be a detailed primer on fractals, and specifically fractals resulting from an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system\">“iterated function system” or IFS</a>, but here are the basics.  Many systems in nature exhibit features that look very similar to each other.  That is, leaves on a tree, mountains, crystal structures, cells, snowflakes, etc.  How can we try to simulate these patterns in a simple system to generate complex results.  The IFS routines in these systems are kind of like DNA in a cell.  Each element in the current generation of a system doesn’t know where it came from, but does know how to create the next generation in the system.  How about an example.\r\n\r\nStart with a square.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/fractal_it1.png\"><img style=\"display: inline; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"fractal_it1\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/fractal_it1_thumb.png\" alt=\"fractal_it1\" width=\"237\" height=\"244\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe shape you start with really doesn’t matter.  What you end up with is making a “collage” of whatever shape you start with, a square is simple and fills the space nicely (which will be important later).\r\n\r\nNow we need to add some simple transformation rules.  We’ll do a “classic” Serpinski triangle or “gasket”.\r\n\r\nA transformation rule generally has four parts: Scale, Rotation, Translation, and Probability.\r\n\r\nIn this case each of the three translations will scale 50% on both axes and have no rotation (0 degrees).\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>The first will not move at all (i.e. translate (0,0)).</li>\r\n	<li>The second will be a full width horizontally away (width, 0).</li>\r\n	<li>The third will be a full width vertically away and a half-width horizontally away (width/2, width)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/fractal_it2.png\"><img style=\"display: inline;

border-width: 0px;\" title=\"fractal_it3\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/fractal_it3_thumb.png\" alt=\"fractal_it3\" width=\"241\" height=\"244\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAnd so on and so on.  What if we did this 7 times?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/fractal_it7.png\"><img style=\"display: inline;

Hand-held calculators weren’t even widely available, no public Internet, 3 TV channels, etc., etc.</p>  <p>What we did have was an accessible programming language that came with most computers: BASIC.&#160; In fact, there wasn’t even much software that you could buy for your computer.&#160; You had to write your own, and the language and environment was built-in to the machine.&#160; A little later came LOGO, and even later came HyperCard for the Macintosh.&#160; So for a kid with access to a computer, and a little interest, motivation, and summer break, you could spend hours programming and creating basic games with text, graphics and even sound.</p>  <p>Ironically, with all the advances in 30 years we have largely lost the entry-level development environment that kids can experiment and get started with.&#160; Sure there are free tools for .NET, Java, PHP, etc. but they start at a much higher level and have so many commands and options that it is easy to get confused.&#160; What kids need is a “level 0” or “level 1” type environment that is limited but easy to use (and did I mention fun?).</p>  <p>Not every kid needs to learn to write complex programs.&#160; But a generation of kids growing up without even a basic knowledge of how computer programs are written make them unaware of how things work and end up victims or slaves of the very technology that is meant to help them.</p>  <p>So for the last 4-5 years I’ve been on an active search for current options for kids who are even mildly interested in programming.&#160; They need to be risk-free (i.e. kids can play around with them without damaging anything), fun (no kid-assembly language primers here), and have the ability to scale to average homes.</p>  <p>I have made no conclusions here, but I wanted to list the environments I am using and “tracking” currently.&#160; We started the “Bots on the Rock” robotics club in January 2008 and that has been doing well with kids 8-15.&#160; In just the last month I started using Kodu on the XBox 360 at home, and now on the PC with the idea of using that with the club as well.&#160; I am going to do a quick listing of what’s available, with more details to follow.&#160; </p>  <h2>Kodu: Game Programming Lab (XBox 360, PC (in Beta)) – 400 XBox “points”</h2>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/kodu.jpg\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"kodu\" border=\"0\" alt=\"kodu\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/kodu_thumb.jpg\" width=\"452\" height=\"253\" /></a> </p>  <p>The latest item on my list is <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/kodu/\">Kodu: Game Programming Lab from Microsoft Research</a>.&#160; I put it first mainly because that is what I’ve been “talking” about on Twitter/Facebook which lead to this post (i.e. can’t explain all of this in 140 characters). <a href=\"http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/games/offers/00000001-0000-4000-8000-00005855024c?partner=RSS\">Kodu is available today for the XBox 360</a> and and Academic version is in beta test for the PC for release in the near future.&#160; As of today I have the PC version running on my laptop and I will be working with that more over the weekend.&#160; We’ve been using the XBox 360 version for just under a month, and all of my kids really love playing with it and are making their own games – in fact they’d rather “play” Kodu than many of the other “real” games.</p>  <p>Kodu is difficult to explain in words, and really needs to be demoed – here is one of the better YouTube videos out there.</p> <object width=\"450\" height=\"360\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/BRz8vb6zVAw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/BRz8vb6zVAw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"450\" height=\"360\"></embed></object>  <p>Basically all of the programming is done with an XBox controller (even on the PC) with a very intuitive series of “sensors” and “commands” (e.g. when I see a ball go towards it).&#160; It also controls a very robust scene generator which enables a huge variety of terrains and elements to be included in the games.</p>  <p>The recent update of Kodu on the XBox 360 allows for much easier sharing of games that you have created.&#160; You can even create multiplayer (local) games, and quickly learn about the headaches that come from multiplayer games on the same screen.&#160; </p>  <p>There are a whole series of posts that could be written just about this environment, but for now I’ll leave you with the links.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h2>NXT-G: Lego Mindstorms (PC, Mac) – Included with LEGO Mindstorms Kit ($275)</h2>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/nxt-g.jpg\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"nxt-g\" border=\"0\" alt=\"nxt-g\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/nxt-g_thumb.jpg\" width=\"454\" height=\"330\" /></a> </p>  <p></p>  <p><a href=\"http://mindstorms.lego.com/overview/NXT_Software.aspx\">NXT-G is the graphical programming environment that comes with the LEGO Mindstorms Robotics kits</a>.&#160; The environment is a “click and drag” programming surface where programs are created by stacking and ordering blocks on the screen (much like building LEGO buildings, hmmm).&#160; Blocks are called “Move”, “Loop”, and have sensor blocks that correspond to the robotic sensors in the kit (e.g. touch sensor, ultrasonic (distance) sensor, sound, light, and now color in the 2.0 kit).&#160; The NXT-G application is actually an implementation of National Instruments LabVIEW graphical programming software which is used professionally by engineers and scientists.&#160; In fact, you can use <a href=\"http://www.ni.com/academic/mindstorms/\">LabVIEW to do some advanced things</a> with the robots that NXT-G will not handle.</p>  <p>The Education version of the NXT-G kit is now up to version 2.0 and contains separate modules for doing data logging and support new sensors like the temperature sensors.&#160; In addition third party sensors can be added for specific needs – for example we added Compass and IRSeeker sensors from HiTechnic when we were doing our series with the robotics club on LEGO Soccer (i.e. needed to “find the ball” (bright IR source) and know “which way” was the opponent’s goal).</p>  <p>Dragging and dropping controls is quite easy for most students – in fact the biggest challenge continues to be slowing kids down and having them try to think through and plan out a solution instead of just barreling right into programming.&#160; Probably an ongoing struggle for many programmers out there.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h2>Small Basic (PC) - Free</h2>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/smallbasic.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"smallbasic\" border=\"0\" alt=\"smallbasic\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/smallbasic_thumb.png\" width=\"454\" height=\"345\" /></a> </p>  <p><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/cc950524.aspx\">Small Basic came out of Microsoft’s DevLabs</a> as a simple programming language for kids to get started with.&#160; It is unique among many of the rest in that it allows for the direct entering of programming code, whereas most of the others have gone to a graphical programming language.&#160; It also preserves a lot of the BASIC syntax (15 keywords) so it will be comfortable for many adults that are assisting and mentoring kids who are starting to program.&#160; It also means that the age range probably scoots up a few to perhaps 10-16.</p>  <p>The power of Small Basic comes in it’s simplicity (look at the tool bar compared to Visual Studio, Eclipse, or any other professional tool set).&#160; There is only so much you can do and experimentation is easy to get into and execute.&#160; Another part of the power comes from the .NET Framework.&#160; There are many libraries included (Flickr one is shown) and others are being developed.&#160; If there is something you want your Small Basic program to do, that it doesn’t to right now, develop a Class in your favorite .NET language and Small Basic will be able to access the functionality.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h2>Scratch (PC, Mac) - Free</h2>  <p><a href=\"http://scratch.mit.edu/\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px;

With the backing of the Media Lab and some key educators (and as it is free) this is a platform that is growing in general adoption and use.&#160; It is probably also in the 10-16 year age range and has many key features.</p>  <p>One of the other programs, besides BASIC, that I really miss is “Storybook Weaver” which enabled students to write stories with animated and multimedia features included.&#160; Scratch, and next Alice, offer a lot in the way of storytelling in addition to programming.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h2>Alice (PC, Mac – Java) - Free</h2>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/alice.jpg\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px;

Creating 3D objects is hard but not impossible, and better tools are coming out all the time.&#160; There are freely available 3D models that are being created by the community for use by others in Alice.</p>  <p>I have not used Alice, but that is only because of a lack of time and resources and not because of any other reason.&#160; Here’s a video promoting Alice and showing many of its features.</p> <object width=\"450\" height=\"360\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/aPN4fEPldoc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/aPN4fEPldoc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"450\" height=\"360\"></embed></object>  <p>Like Scratch there is a nice storytelling component in Alice which is currently called “Storytelling Alice” (soon to be “Looking Glass”).&#160; So whereas the Alice 2.0/3.0 environments themselves are better suited for a formal class in programming, a more informal and easy-to-use version for storytelling (and basic programming) is available.</p>  <p>Now strongly allied with Java, Alice is extensible via Java which makes many other possibilities available for more advanced porgrammers.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h2>KPL / Phrogram (PC) - $35-$50 + more for additional libraries</h2>  <p>Lastly, to be complete in this list I wanted to include the <a href=\"http://www.kidsprogramminglanguage.com\">Kids Programming Language (KPL)</a> which has been retired, but has resurfaced as <a href=\"http://phrogram.com/\">Phrogram</a>.&#160; The KPL effort was intended to create a simple programming language for kids that would allow for rich graphics capabilities and be extensible using the .NET Framework.&#160; Admittedly I have not used or tried using the product since it became Phrogram, so I can’t make any recommendations.&#160; On the surface it appears that the communities surrounding the other products are more active and current.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h2>In Conclusion – there are no Conclusions</h2>  <p>I am glad that the market for kids programming environments is heating up and that there may actually be competition instead of a big giant hole.&#160; I am actively using NXT-G on a regular basis and am really starting to like Kodu (more each time I use it).&#160; In considering a class or even formal curriculum for “next steps” I am watching Small Basic, Scratch, and Alice and expect to be using one or more of these in 2010.</p>','Programming for Today’s Kids','','inherit','open','open','','35-revision','','','2009-08-04 05:56:41','2009-08-04 05:56:41','',35,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2009/08/35-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(23,2,'2010-01-29 05:14:45','2010-01-29 05:14:45','<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/ipad.jpg\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 5px 10px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"ipad\" border=\"0\" alt=\"ipad\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/ipad_thumb.jpg\" width=\"244\" height=\"179\" /></a> So there have been a few days since the iPad announcement and it is a lot of what people are talking about right now.&#160; Several people are wanting to be first in line to get one of the new iPads.&#160; Others have a lot of questions and criticisms of the unit that was announced. I looked at my own comments and critiques and I think I know why I was personally underwhelmed.</p>  <p>First, I am a life-long Apple fan.&#160; I’ve had and Apple ][+, Apple IIe, Apple IIc, Mac SE/30, IIsi, Quadra 610, PowerBook 100 &amp; 170, G3, G4 etc.&#160; I still have a Newton MessagePad 110 at home that I fire up every few years (fooled a few folks that it was a prototype iPhone a while back) and may be one of the few people anywhere that used an eMate 300. I’ve also had one (or more) of the iPods since Generation 2.</p>  <p>Since the day I got my first Apple][+ I have been programming on computers – you had to back then, there was very little commercial software available for purchase (and no downloads).&#160; I only mention this, because whenever I get a new piece of technology I want to see how I can customize it or extend it by writing some code or “hacking” the unit a little bit (and sometimes have to buy a second unit after irreversibly removing or changing one too many things).&#160; I want my technology to be adaptable and open for me to use in ways perhaps not even intended by the creators.</p>  <h2>Health Care, Education &amp; E-Commerce</h2>  <p>My three biggest types of customers right now are health care, education and e-commerce.&#160; The iPad is great for commerce – perhaps too great.&#160; If you want to sell audio, video, books, or iPad-specific apps, the iPad is a mini-mall full of shopping opportunities from anywhere with connectivity.&#160; The iPad may be&#160; the device with the most potential for generating ongoing revenue of any device in history.&#160; But for health care and education there are some non-trivial issues.&#160; </p>  <p>First, there are 10+ years worth of software written for health care and education that run on Macintosh and Windows platforms.&#160; None of this software will run on the iPad.&#160; Some educational games like Oregon Trail have updated and rewritten their titles to run on the iPhone, but 99% of the software ever written will not run on the iPad.&#160; This is disappointing. </p>  <p>I have also not heard of any way to get software on to these devices other than the App Store.&#160; That is a school or hospital IT department can not stage a standard device and replicate it across many units, and I don’t see the ability to enable/restrict the stock iPad software that comes with the unit.&#160; These are important tasks for tech people in both schools and medical facilities.</p>  <h2>Small Macintosh or Large iPod?</h2>  <p>I think my confusion and disappointment with the iPad came because I didn’t know if Apple’s tablet offering was going to be a “Macintosh” or an “iPod”.&#160; That is, would it run the full OS X kernel that would allow Macintosh software to run, or would it be the more limited sub-set that enabled the iPhone.&#160; If it was a tablet Macintosh then I could hack/code it with technologies ranging from the unix tools, Macintosh-specific SDKs, Java, Flash and even Silverlight.&#160; Plus, I could use the tablet itself to create software for the tablet – how cool would that be.&#160; </p>  <h2>Consumer vs. Creator</h2>  <p>But I am not the “average user” intended for this device, which I can understand.&#160; The sad thing is that the apparent target user for the iPad is focused 95% on being a <u>consumer</u> and maybe 5% on being a <u>creator</u>.&#160; If you want to buy music on the iPad you are fine.&#160; If you want to compose or record music then you’ll need another device.&#160; If you want to read a book or magazine you are fine, if you want to write a non-trivial amount of text you will need another device or an awkward docking station.&#160; If you want to use a bunch of other people’s applications that are accepted through the App Store vetting process, then you are fine.&#160; If you want to write your own applications you will need another device.</p>  <h2>Selling to Paying Clients</h2>  <p>My other problem now is explaining these issues to clients who want to create rich applications for their users.&#160; A very typical request from clients is that they want a great user experience and application that will run on Macs, Windows and mobile devices.&#160; It appears that Apple’s philosophy in this area is that there should be a custom version for the iPhone, one for the iPad, one for the Macintosh and (if necessary) one for Windows (and maybe even one for Linux). iPhone apps will run on the iPad in either “mini-mode” or “pixel doubling” neither of which is very compelling. iPad specific apps (e.g. iWork) will probably never run on the iPhone.&#160; If I wrote a great iPhone app, that won’t run on the Mac or Windows.</p>  <p>So if I want my application to work in multiple environments that is 3-5 completely different applications in almost as many different programming environments and languages.&#160; That is a tough sell to a client – this will take a lot more money and require a lot of different talent on the same project (and don’t get me started on code coverage for testing this variety of solutions).</p>  <h2>Coding Cross-Platform</h2>  <p>I want to be able to code something once, and have it be portable to as many different environments as possible.&#160; In a nutshell, this is why there are many people clamoring for including Flash and Silverlight on the iPhone and iPad.&#160; These are established platforms with tens of thousands of designers and developers who must now create multiple applications in different environments if they want to support the iPad.&#160; There are finally two ways to create rich applications for Mac, Windows and Linux but only one way to create applications for the iPad.&#160; This is why I’d really love to see support for Flash and Silverlight in the future.&#160; Even if Flash and Silverlight were stand-alone applications that you had to get from the App Store, but allowed you to run cross-platform software within them.&#160; By the way I could care less if Safari on the iPad ever supported either as a plugin. </p>  <h2>Unfortunate Choices, But Not “Wrong”</h2>  <p>Finally I want to clear one more thing up. Some people have said that Apple should not be “forced” to open up their iPad operating system to alternate programming platforms – legally or otherwise - and I totally disagree.&#160; People can vote on this with their purchases; if they want to consume their content and entertainment on an iPad, and create it on a separate device, then that is perfectly fine.&#160; That is, Apple’s decisions about the iPad are not “wrong” they are just “unfortunate” for me and the people I am trying to serve and support.</p>','Evaluating the iPad: Consumer vs. Creator vs. Cross Platform','','publish','open','open','','evaluating-the-ipad-consumer-vs-creator-vs-cross-platform','','','2010-01-29 05:14:45','2010-01-29 05:14:45','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Evaluating-the-iPad-Consumer-vs-Creator-vs-Cross-Platform.aspx',0,'post','',5),(24,2,'2010-01-07 03:35:23','2010-01-07 03:35:23','<p>The CodeMash conference is next week – it is a regional “software developer smörgåsbord” covering topics on a wide variety of technologies, patterns and processes.&#160; There are times when all 650ish attendees are together for keynotes and meals, but at other times there are 5-6+ different sessions going on throughout the conference center.</p>  <p>Traditional methods for getting information to attendees at conferences such as this is a printed program with all the tracks, sessions, speaker info, and location maps with all the rooms that sessions are taking place.&#160; This year, the organizers of CodeMash made available a set of web services using industry standard protocols that included all of this information.&#160; Then they left it up to the CodeMash community to come up with creating great applications to use this data.</p>  <p>At this time there are apps using many different platforms and technologies, but I wanted to focus on the iPod/iPhone apps (because that is the mobile device that I have) – see the CodeMash main site for more info <a href=\"http://www.codemash.org\">http://www.codemash.org</a></p>  <p>Our team is taking five members to CodeMash this year, so we are getting together today to go over the schedule and decide which sessions we should try to all get to together and which ones we could “divide and conquer”, so I added the 3 iPod applications that I could find today to my Touch.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/threeicons.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 15px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"threeicons\" border=\"0\" alt=\"threeicons\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/threeicons_thumb.png\" width=\"244\" height=\"96\" /></a> </p>  <p>The three apps I could find for the iPhone were iCodeMash, MobiMash, and a “CodeMash 2010 Scheduler”.&#160; The first is a web offline HTML application, and the other two are available in the AppStore (search on CodeMash). I was wondering if the offline HTML application would be able to have the same functionality as a “full iPhone application” and I have to say that I was really impressed with how much can be done using the tools available.</p>  <p>This will really not be a review/recommendation for these applications – they are all free of charge and I will have all of them on my iPod for the conference.&#160; Rather, I wanted to review how the different authors and teams implemented features and see how many things were the same, but some features were innovative and even surprising.&#160; I won’t go application-by-application then, but feature by feature and show how all three were implemented.</p>  <h2>Splash Screen</h2>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0042.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px;

</p>  <p>The iCodeMash application is very conscious of the “above the fold” region of the different areas of the app.&#160; It is also seems to be written to be used “at” the conference as well as “before” the conference.&#160; It automatically highlights the next session and has a quick-link to your favorites.&#160; Because this is not a full iPhone application, the button bar at the bottom is not used.&#160; iCodeMash approaches the schedule from primarily a day/time standpoint.&#160; The “next step” from this start screen would be to go view the next session, list of favorites, or review the schedule by day/time.</p>  <p>MobiMash starts with a news feed from CodeMash which is updated regularly.&#160; This may be updated during the conference as well, so this would be a good way to get late-breaking news at the top-level of the application.&#160; From this screen, you can view a list of all of the sessions, review those you have tagged as favorites, see a map of the venue.&#160; The More button reveals access to Speaker info, a Twitter feed of the #CodeMash hashtag (nice feature) as well as a “Right Now” and “Next” functionality which will be functional in the future.</p>  <p>The Scheduler application starts with a menu featuring links to sessions, but adds the ability to filter by Level and Track which may be helpful in finding topics that are attendee-appropriate.&#160; The button bar provides a “My Sessions” button that displays sessions that have been added to your favorites, and a News button which shows the CodeMash news feed.</p>  <h2>Pick Sessions</h2>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0036.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px;

If you select the “star” symbol on the description then this one will become a selection/favorite (very much like many Google apps use).&#160; Also in the description is a link to the room that this session is taking place in, with the specific room highlighted with a blue dot.&#160;

This screen feels and works much like a web page.&#160; At the bottom of the session description is a unique feature to rate the session if you have attended it.&#160; I am not sure where this information surfaces, but it takes the application into the feedback/recap part of the process</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0053.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px;

MobiMash enables this on the button bar at the bottom. iCodeMash includes a link from the session description.&#160; iCodeMash goes one step more and includes a little blue dot highlighting the room that the selected session which is very thoughtful.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0050.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px;

This is also quite cool and may be the way to find the most current info from the cloud at the Conference</p>  <h2>Ideas While Reviewing</h2>  <p>This is the first year that CodeMash has made the conference data available for public consumption as web services.&#160; I have to say that all of these developers and groups have done a real service in pulling these applications together.&#160; I hope this is the first of many years that CodeMash, and other conferences, will offer information like this for applications.</p>  <p>I couldn’t help but think of what the next-generation applications might try to take on in future releases – what might be the most useful and interesting things to add?</p>  <p><strong>Additional Mashups – Twitter, Blog, LinkedIn, Google Group, Facebook, etc.</strong></p>  <p>I liked what MobiMash started with the integration of Twitter feeds with the #CodeMash hashtag.&#160; Why not extend this and include links from the speaker/bio information to their personal Twitter feeds (can learn a lot about someone from their feed).&#160; Why stop there?&#160; Integrate an RSS/Atom feed from their blog into the application as well.&#160; Basic information from LinkedIn might also be useful.&#160; In addition to bringing in the news feed from CodeMash, why not also include a summary feed from the Google Group where interesting conversations and threads are taking place.</p>  <p><strong>Backchannel – During the Sessions/Conference</strong></p>  <p>The Twitter feeds are a good start of this, but wouldn’t it be nice if there was a place where people could post comments, ideas, questions, etc. that were session-specific?&#160; Speakers could get an idea of how their audience is responding, and people outside the session could get an idea of what happened in the session or even if they should gracefully exit their session and join an ongoing discussion.</p>  <p><strong>Followup – After</strong></p>  <p>Many/most speakers who have PowerPoint decks or code samples as part of their session will create a blog post and attach these resources to the post.&#160; Comments on these posts can serve to give the speaker feedback and continue the conversation.&#160; MobiMash had the idea of a 5-star rating system for sessions that you attended – this is a start.&#160; But if the applications could contain access to follow-up posts and comments from the session then they would have value even after the conference was over.</p>  <p><strong>Framework</strong></p>  <p>And then you end up saying “If this can be done for CodeMash, couldn’t there be a framework or platform that could be used at the 1000s of conferences that go on every year?”&#160; Wouldn’t it be cool if a standard schema could be agreed on for sessions, speakers, venues, news, etc. that the major conferences, even just technology conferences, could all use so that all the work these developers have put into these apps could “pay if forward” and be used beneficially in the future.</p>  <p>In summary, great job to all the developers – Jonathan Penn (<a href=\"http://wavethenavel.com\">http://wavethenavel.com</a>) for iCodeMash, SRT Solutions with Jay Wren (<a title=\"http://jrwren.wrenfam.com/blog/\" href=\"http://jrwren.wrenfam.com/blog/\">http://jrwren.wrenfam.com/blog/</a> <a href=\"http://mobimash.org\">http://mobimash.org</a> ) for MobiMash, and QuickSolutions (<a href=\"http://www.quicksolutions.com\">http://www.quicksolutions.com</a>) for CodeMash iPhone Scheduler.&#160;

This is our second year as a Silverlight Partner, but our first time attending the summit, and it was well worth the trip to Redmond.&#160; I am still really processing all that was announced for Silverlight 4 this month, and the additional content from the summit, but I wanted to get a few things down here while it is current.&#160; There are some things learned at the conference that I can’t post here quite yet, but the vast majority of important details have been recently announced publically, and more is coming very soon.</p>  <h3>1) Community is Critical for Continuous Growth and Progress</h3>  <p>Events like the summit just reinforce my belief that the only real and lasting way to learn new skills or technologies is within a community of people who are also learning and creating new projects. The ability to toss ideas off of other people, make discoveries and solve problems together – this is huge. It was great to be in a group where you could hear something and look at another attendee and say something like “That is about as useful as an ‘AG_E_UNKNOWN_ERROR’” and have a quick laugh without the other person looking at you like you are out of your mind (and if you don’t understand the Silverlight reference, insert your own “private joke” here and move on).</p>  <p>The community I’ve had while learning Silverlight has really just been the handful of people on our development team and those Twitter contacts who are working on similar things.&#160; I got to talk to a bunch of people who are also “in the boat” at the summit and made a few lasting contacts that I look forward to staying in touch with.&#160; I am also trying to get a group together in our area who are doing Silverlight (or starting to) – if you are interested let me know.&#160; Even a small group meeting informally would be really nice to get started.</p>  <h3>2) Silverlight Video is Something I Have Underutilized – This Needs to Change</h3>  <p>Video was the premiere feature of Silverlight 1 and has only grown in features and power since then.&#160; I have spent the majority of my time developing for Silverlight creating business line-of-business (LOB) applications (e.g. data forms, grids, charts, etc.) and not “entertainment” applications (e.g. audio, video, animation).</p>  <p>Seeing what some of the partners have done with the Olympics, NFL, Netflix, etc. is amazing, and on a scale that our customers and applications do not approach.&#160; But I also talked with people who’s companies are working with corporate and educational video management and distribution software for learning and training.&#160; This just makes sense, and is so easy to do now with Silverlight.&#160; If you are going to include a “help” or “about” section in a LOB application, why not include a short video and/or screencast illustrating the point instead of just describing it in text and maybe a few screenshots.&#160; Something to think about and implement as soon as I can.</p>  <h3>3) Scott Gu is the Real Deal</h3>  <p>There were, of course, many people from Microsoft at the summit. I was really impressed with the attitude and approachability of all of them that I listened to and interacted with.&#160; There was a lot of interest and excitement from the attendees of the summit, but what surprised me was the interest and excitement from the Microsoft staff as well.&#160; As interested as we were in hearing about upcoming technologies, strategies, best practices and key projects using Silverlight, the Microsoft people were very interested to hear what people were using the tools for and what we needed and wanted from the platform going forward.&#160; So in the same way that we were reenergized by what we were hearing and seeing, the Microsoft folks seem reenergized to hear about all the cool, innovative and unexpected things were doing with the tools they were creating.</p>  <p>I guess I have been to so many canned and half-hearted presentations in my life, that I had really lowered my expectations in a way.&#160; I highlighted Scott Guthrie in the title of this section, but this really goes for all of the Microsoft people who we interacted with.&#160; Scott, though, had a few aspects that were, in my mind, even over top of all the rest.&#160; First, he missed the first day of the summit and the keynote because his plane from Paris was stopped, held and searched by authorities which caused connection problems down the line.&#160; But the point is he not only came back from a whirlwind tour of European countries, but scheduled a “Scott Gu Unplugged” session at the beginning of the second day moving our agenda start up an hour.&#160; In this session he opened Notepad and took any and all questions from the group, and answered every one of them – several that I didn’t expect him to answer – and was open and honest about issues and plans going forward. </p>  <h3>4) Silverlight 4 and SharePoint 2010 Will Be a LOB Powerhouse</h3>  <p>I was really surprised when Silverlight 4 was not only demoed at the Professional Developers Conference (PDC) a few weeks ago, but a full-blown beta was released.&#160; This followed the beta release of SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 in November.&#160; If you haven’t read about the new features in Silverlight 4, go read through one of the great write-ups (like <a href=\"http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2009/11/18/whats-new-in-silverlight-4-complete-guide-new-features.aspx\">Tim Heuer’s</a> and samples from <a href=\"http://scorbs.com/2009/11/19/pdc-session-silverlight-4-beta-overview/\">Karen Corby</a>) and then come back – ok, now consider some of the back-end enterprise power of <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/ketaanhs/archive/2009/10/25/new-features-sharepoint-2010-a-k-a-sharepoint-14.aspx\">SharePoint 2010</a>.&#160; Both Silverlight 4 and SharePoint 2010 will be powerful alone – taken together they combine to provide unprecedented power for Rich Enterprise Applications (REAs?).&#160; All the rich user interface tools and potential combined with security, workflow, services, and Office integration will enable some really useful applications – especially if you leverage the Silverlight 4 COM support.</p>  <p>One thing I took away from the first day of the summit was something I guess I knew but really didn’t “get”.&#160; In talking to some of the “big name” customers/developers at the summit, I realized that these big companies had teams using every conceivable technology platform out there including Flash/Flex/AIR, Java FX, and even a few others.&#160; They were not using Silverlight just because it was from Microsoft - they were using Silverlight for new projects because it was simply the best platform currently available for what they need to get done.&#160; For one of them they evaluated Silverlight 2 and decided quickly against it.&#160; Silverlight 3 was significantly improved and they started some initial prototypes and projects with it.&#160; Now with the feature set of Silverlight 4 in preview, and soon to be released to the public, there is a platform that is a generation ahead in many areas.&#160; Beyond this, it sounds like the development team isn’t slowing down with implementing key features even after Silverlight 4 and the mobile/device announcement coming at MIX’10.</p>  <h3>5) Great Tools Make Great Things Possible</h3>  <p>It is one thing to have a great platform with a lot of power and features.&#160; It is quite another thing to have a full-featured set of tools that enable teams to build and test complex applications.&#160; Visual Studio has been the industry standard for developer productivity for years.&#160; With Visual Studio 2010 and Blend 3 (with SketchFlow) the bar has been raised again.&#160; If you spend days in Visual Studio now doing development, you should try out some other toolsets sometime to just realize how lucky you really are – if you don’t use Visual Studio you might not want to check it out unless you are able to switch.&#160; I know that I have grown to rely on a unified toolset that lets me develop everything from the browser, through the services to the database and back again – in one tool.&#160; Those who are working in other environments face a daunting task of development and testing.</p>','What I Learned at the Silverlight Partner Summit 2009','','publish','open','open','','what-i-learned-at-the-silverlight-partner-summit-2009','','','2009-12-16 07:24:35','2009-12-16 07:24:35','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/What-I-Learned-at-the-Silverlight-Partner-Summit-2009.aspx',0,'post','',2),(26,2,'2009-12-07 17:30:35','2009-12-07 17:30:35','<ul class=\'diigo-linkroll\'><li><p class=\'diigo-link\'><a rel=\'nofollow\' href=\'http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/football/ncaa/08/11/bowl-schedule/index.html\'>College football bowl schedule for 2009-10 season - NCAA Football - SI.com</a></p><p class=\'diigo-tags\'><a style=\'color:#000 !important;text-decoration:none !important;\' href=\'http://www.diigo.com/cloud/babernethy\'>tags</a>: <a href=\'http://www.diigo.com/user/babernethy/no_tag\'>no_tag</a></p><ul class=\'diigo-highlights\'><li><div class=\"diigoContent\"><div class=\"diigoContentInner\"><strong>GMAC</strong></div></div></li></ul></ul><br />Posted from <a href=\'http://www.diigo.com\'>Diigo</a>.

This is a server-side technology that is integrated with IIS server.&#160; This does not mean that Silverlight applications run on the iPhone.&#160; If and when this happens this will be a big deal.&#160; For now, what this means for video content providers is that they can have a single solution to provide high-quality streaming video to both the desktop computer and the iPhone.&#160; Why the confusion here?&#160; I think a few poorly titled “news” articles/releases and blog posts and a bunch of trolls latching on to it.</p>  <h3>Silverlight Ending Cross-Platform Development</h3>  <p>The Silverlight runtime is becoming available on a number of new platfroms from desktops (Win/Mac &amp; Linux with Moonlight), to hand-held devices, to TV-top and game consoles.&#160; Across all of these platforms there is a core Silverlight that runs 100% the same in each environment.&#160; But with each environment also comes some critical and desired functionality that is unique to that environment.&#160; On the XBOX you’ll want to be able to access game controllers (perhaps multiple), for touch screens you’ll want to be able to support touch and multi-touch capability, on a phone you will want to be able to dial the phone, if there is a GPS or accelerometer in the device you’ll be want to access that as well.&#160; These are all unique to specific devices and don’t exist on the other devices.&#160; Supporting one or more of these would not mean that Silverlight was not “cross-platform”, just that it enabled high-value specialized capability where it exists.</p>  <p>The “truth part” of this false accusation is the announced support for COM interaction in Silverlight on the Windows platform.&#160; What this means is that Silverlight will be able to call out to certain external code on machines if they exist.&#160; This means that a datagrid on the Silverlight screen could be easily sent to Excel, or an appointment could be sent to Outlook, a chart could be exported as a report to Word, etc.&#160; The grid, appointment and chart will exist cross-platform for all environments.&#160; The only difference is, if you happen to be on Windows with the right software installed there is additional functionality that can be quite useful.&#160; This is an example of a request from developers who are creating Silverlight applications for Enterprise Business customers who are requesting these types of features.</p>  <p>Why the confusion here?&#160; I think there is a small group of people who believe that cross-platform has to mean “least common denominator” – that is, if a feature/function can’t be used in 100% of the places where the software runs, then it isn’t “cross-platform”.&#160; In the iPhone world this would mean that applications couldn’t use the GPS or dialer because the apps might be used on the iPod Touch (where these don’t exist), or applications couldn’t support touch-screens because most people don’t have them.&#160; It will be up to the developers to make sure that their applications work well in all situations, but this shouldn’t prevent them from taking advantage of added features where they exist. </p>','Confusion and FUD around Silverlight PDC Announcements','','publish','open','open','','confusion-and-fud-around-silverlight-pdc-announcements','','','2009-12-01 04:49:35','2009-12-01 04:49:35','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Confusion-and-FUD-around-Silverlight-PDC-Announcements.aspx',0,'post','',0),(28,2,'2009-11-26 17:30:23','2009-11-26 17:30:23','<ul class=\'diigo-linkroll\'><li><p class=\'diigo-link\'><a rel=\'nofollow\' href=\'http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3000-3299/pages/3101.htm\'>Catan Portable Edition</a></p><p class=\'diigo-tags\'><a style=\'color:#000 !important;text-decoration:none !important;\' href=\'http://www.diigo.com/cloud/babernethy\'>tags</a>: <a href=\'http://www.diigo.com/user/babernethy/no_tag\'>no_tag</a></p><ul class=\'diigo-highlights\'><li><div class=\"diigoContent\"><div class=\"diigoContentInner\"><span class=\"style53\">Catan Portable Edition</span><span class=\"style54\">™</span></div></div></li></ul></ul><br />Posted from <a href=\'http://www.diigo.com\'>Diigo</a>.

We …</p>  <ul>   <li>Didn’t go get my daughter leaf blower manual and have her read through it (and have a written test for her afterwards). </li>    <li>Didn’t tell her to go Google “Leaf Blowing” and see what other people trying to leaf-blow had done </li>    <li>Didn’t sign her up for the two-day “Leaf Blowing 101” class, or get us plane tickets to Vegas for the latest “Leaf Blowing Futures 2009&quot; Conference.” </li>    <li>Didn’t start her on a fake project in the “Leaf Lab” where she blows artificial leaves through a series of increasingly complicated leaf-blowing scenarios </li>    <li>and I Didn’t buy her the latest “Leaf Blowing for Dummies”&#160;

All the basic strategies still work, and still work well.&#160; Once we get the idea that learning can only come from a book or a class, or worse yet – that our training or learning is the responsibility of anyone but ourselves, we really lose sight of the most natural and powerful models for learning.&#160;

One such thing is school funding, and that is all over the news lately.&#160; So, quick post – click the back-button now if you were hoping for something more typical on my blog.</p>  <p>So the Michigan budget woes have brought up the issue of school funding again – the Governor wants to cut $100-$200 from the per student payout to try to balance the budget.&#160; This would bring the minimum per-student payout down to ~$7,300 with the average per-student rate in the state going down to between $8,000-$9,500.&#160; Some in the state are worried that this will not be enough to provide an adequate education for the kids in the state.&#160; Everyone seems to be ready to say what they would cut first if money got tight – usually hot-button areas like bus transportation, after-school programs, or even football!&#160; But I haven’t seen anyone explain what it is they do with the money they do get.&#160; Someone has got to know this – please help me out here.</p>  <p>Let me break this down to start the discussion.&#160; In order to do this math I am going to try to use approximate numbers – I’ll try to use a lower/fair number to keep the discussion fair.&#160; Let’s say that students in Michigan get $8,000 each per year for school.</p>  <p><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"8kperstudent\" border=\"0\" alt=\"8kperstudent\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/8kperstudent.png\" width=\"412\" height=\"82\" /> </p>  <p>That’s sounds like a decent amount to get an education.&#160; It isn’t a fortune but it has potential.&#160; Especially if you match it with some other students in a classroom.&#160; When I was in school we had about 30 kids in a classroom 5x6 grid of desks – this is too many.&#160; Let’s say you had a classroom of 28 students in it, how much money would we have then?</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/224kperclassroom.png\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px;

Now we are talking.&#160; Let’s say we had a school then with two classrooms per grade K-6.&#160; This is a nice sized school, but not overly big – again, like I remember from growing up.&#160; How much money would we have then?&#160;

Almost took out my computer copying and pasting that many virtual $1000 bills.</p>  <p>So our hypothetical school with 392 kids has a nice budget to work with for the year (each year).&#160; So what do we do with this money – that is what I am trying to figure out.</p>  <p>Let’s pay the staff first – they are the ones that do the work (and many/most do a great job – that is totally not the point of this post).</p>  <h2>Staff</h2>  <p>Let’s build a nice staff</p>  <ul>   <li>14 Teachers</li>    <li>1 Principal</li>    <li>1 Secretary</li>    <li>1 Maintenance Person</li>    <li>1 Nurse</li>    <li>1 Librarian</li>    <li>1 Computer Guy</li> </ul>  <p>Again, I said they do a great job – let’s give them a $100,000 package every year for salary and benefits.&#160; Anyone who tells you teachers work a short day and a short year have probably never known any real teachers.&#160; I can tell you from experience that they put in as many hours or more as people who are on the clock year-round.</p>  <p>So that is $2,000,000 just in salaries.</p>  <p>That takes our budget down to 1.126 million dollars.</p>  <p></p>  <h2>School Building</h2>  <p>We also want a great building.&#160; Let’s build a $4,000,000 building with a 30-year mortgage.&#160; That is about $20,000/month for the loan or $240,000/year.&#160; If you argue that this is too little or miscalculated, also please realize that school districts typically pass a millage (additional taxes) to pay for facilities which are over-and-above the per-student payout every year.</p>  <p>Budget now at $886,000</p>  <h2>Utilities</h2>  <p>We have to heat and light the place and keep the computers running.&#160; Let’s budget $5,000/month or $60,000 a year for electricity.&#160; The nice thing about schools is that they do get a nice rate on public utilities so this money will go a long way.</p>  <p>Budget down to $826,000 </p>  <h2>What’s Left – Stuff for the Students</h2>  <p>So here then is my problem.&#160; We are left with $826,000 per school or about $2,100 per student after we’ve built the school, kept it lit and heated, and paid all the paid staff (lots of volunteers in there as well).</p>  <p>Even if you bought every kid a netbook computer every year ($400) and bought all new textbooks every year ($600) you would still have $1,100 per student left.&#160; That buys a lot of paper, pencils, science experiments, sports equipment, etc.</p>  <h2>The Point</h2>  <p>My main point here is that we are struggling as a state with unemployment and the economy – less people paying taxes on less salaries.&#160; Everyone is cutting back.&#160; All other government programs are cutting budgets.&#160; Schools should be able to do the same without that big of a deal.</p>  <p>To get right down to it – Charter schools have 50% the budget of public schools, private schools 15-30%, and homeschools are on their own – and all of these options continue to produce results.</p>  <p>Let’s ride this economic crisis out together and wait for the day when things swing back upward, without bemoaning the small sacrifices that everyone needs to make right now.</p>','Where does all the money for schools go?','','publish','open','open','','where-does-all-the-money-for-schools-go','','','2009-10-27 05:02:42','2009-10-27 05:02:42','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Where-does-all-the-money-for-schools-go.aspx',0,'post','',11),(31,2,'2009-10-14 03:32:56','2009-10-14 03:32:56','<p>Here’s a not-so-hypothetical situation – one night when 15 or so kids are running around the house you happen to leave your laptop in a very public location near where the Wii games are underway.&#160; Inevitably the laptop gets used as a coaster and soon after the cup empties over the laptop.&#160; The top of the laptop gets wiped clean (according to alleged eye-witness testimony), but, hours later, when you pick up the laptop unknowingly, water literally pours from the openings for the fan.&#160; Taking out the battery and DVD drive confirms the worst – everything is at least damp – probably as wet as you could get without submersion.</p>  <p>Don’t Panic.&#160; I’ve been using Windows 7 Hibernate mode lately instead of Sleep so the machine should be powered down. Damage from water/coffee/liquid is usually from an electrical short being caused in the system – no power, no short. Remove the battery so no power is supplied to the unit.&#160; Take the (dripping) laptop into the laundry room and put it on a towel to sop up as much as possible.&#160; Then proceed to remove all of the user-serviceable panels and parts as possible.&#160; I didn’t say this would be easy.</p>  <p>Removed the panels for the hard drive, memory, wireless card (all with water drops on them), then removed the components (i.e. hard drive, memory, card, etc.).&#160; I Also removed the keyboard, which pretty much concludes all the parts that are designed for regular humans to add/update/replace.&#160; Lastly, I did pull out the little “watch battery” on the main board which was exposed to further let air get in there and remove another source of power. Looks like the screen is sealed really well and isn’t showing any fog or moisture – hope for the best.</p>  <p>Put all the bits and pieces on a new dry towel and put a fan on the lot for a full 48 hours.</p>  <p>Time of Reckoning: reassemble all the pieces (only 3 lose screws from the keyboard).&#160; Attach the battery, and start it up (mentally remembering the fire extinguisher is about 6 feet away).&#160; It makes the typical sounds on start up, but has a weird error I haven’t seen.&#160; The CMOS/BIOS values are “corrupted” (doesn’t sound good) but [F5] will enable the default values if I would like – sure.&#160; Windows 7 hibernate/resume starts and I am starting to be cautiously optimistic.&#160; Machine thinks it is January 2001 but a quick settings change corrects that.</p>  <p>Success.</p>  <p>One other thing worth noting is that my initial lack of panic, even though I had a user group presentation scheduled for the next day and all my stuff was on the laptop, was because I had live copies of everything “in the cloud” using Dropbox and Live Mesh (trying them both out for now – like the Dropbox iPhone app feature).</p>  <p>Final note, from past dry-outs of cell phones, if the laptop screen was foggy/wet a way to remove water from a mostly-sealed system is difficult, but not impossible.&#160; If you can carefully package the laptop and introduce it into an environment with some ultra-absorbent material (e.g. instant rice, cat litter) and seal it up, the resulting dry air will pull moisture quite effectively out of just about anything.</p>','Success in drying out waterlogged Laptop','','publish','open','open','','success-in-drying-out-waterlogged-laptop','','','2009-10-14 03:32:56','2009-10-14 03:32:56','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Success-in-drying-out-waterlogged-Laptop.aspx',0,'post','',5),(32,2,'2009-10-05 03:37:03','2009-10-05 03:37:03','<div style=\"margin: 15px; float: right\"><iframe height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/41391628@N02/show/\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" align=\"center\" ?width=\"450\"></iframe></div>  <p>My family has had a great time at ArtPrize these last few weeks visiting as many of the different venues and artists as possible. The final vote is upon us this week and I feel strongly enough about one of the top 10 that I am going to make my intended vote public and let others know why.</p>  <p>First, full disclosure, I am a full 50% Scottish, have been to Loch Ness, and have seriously considered the matter of whether there is or has been a Plesiosaurish orphan in the deep waters (not fully decided either way). Beyond this heritage, I have no other connections with the artists themselves or any of the others or the contest.</p>  <p>Let me list my Top 5 reasons that I think <a href=\"http://www.artprize.org/artist/id/3403\">&quot;Nessie on the Grand&quot;</a> tops the Top 10 for ArtPrize.</p>  <p>Let me start by saying my enthusiasm for Nessie in no way minimizes my respect for the other artists in the contest. In my mind, anyone why was able to pull a piece together and find a venue to show it off, is already a winner. Of the amazing artists in the Top 10, I have seen all but 2 and feel badly that I did not have more time planned to see them all.</p>  <p>The first reason I think Nessie should win is the quality and creativity of the piece - it is very well done. My first thought when seeing the water worm for the first time was that it looked like an Egyptian styled version or something out of Stargate. It is described as &quot;art deco&quot; style, but I just thought it was a nice fresh take on the Loch Ness monster that was updated and very striking.</p>  <p>Second, the sheer size of Nessie is impressive - she is huge! Would the Calder or Da Vinci\'s Horse be as spectacular if they weren\'t bigger than life? When ArtPrize was announced I wondered if anyone would create a piece that would not be restricted by the downtown venues, but actually take advantage of one of the venues downtown. Many artists did this, but Nessie uses one of the greatest features of downtown - the river itself - and makes that part of the art. Brilliant.</p>  <p>Third, I like the fact that Nessie\'s installation is in a venue that is fully public, and would necessarily be public if it were permanently installed. One of the greatest aspects of ArtPrize is that is brought art to the public. Many of the pieces at ArtPrize will go behind closed doors after the competition. If Nessie were to find a permanent home it would need to be outdoors in a river/lake somewhere for people to enjoy. I also like the fact that the artists and team <a href=\"http://nessieproject.wordpress.com/\">blogged and collected video</a> of key moments of the process, and also added social media like <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Grand-Rapids-MI/nessie-project-art-prize-2009/228550575023\">Facebook</a> to add a public community aspect to the project.</p>  <p>Fourth, there is no doubt that Nessie has broad audience appeal across ages and cultures. A big part of my excitement over the piece was the response from my children when they saw it. It is impressive, fun, exciting, and doesn\'t depend on a particular age, culture, or background to appreciate.</p>  <p>Lastly, Nessie was implemented by a group of people who are local to the area. The top four of my reasons would be reasons enough for me, but the fact that the artists responsible are local, outgoing, and very community focused just seals the deal in my mind. I wouldn\'t want artists to think that you had to be from the area to win this wonderful contest. But I would want people to know that, all other things being equal, ties goes to the person or group that can take the prize and encourage others in the area to get out, be creative, and bring their best works forward.</p>','Why I am voting for Nessie','','publish','open','open','','why-i-am-voting-for-nessie','','','2009-10-05 03:37:03','2009-10-05 03:37:03','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Why-I-am-voting-for-Nessie.aspx',0,'post','',4),(33,2,'2009-09-20 23:43:12','2009-09-20 23:43:12','<p>So I have been looking at printers for home since my old HP multifunction printer died in the spring, and used some birthday money and a great sale at OfficeMax to get a new one.&#160; I decided on a color laser printer, the <a href=\"http://www.brother-usa.com/Printer/modeldetail.aspx?PRODUCTID=hl4040cdn&amp;tab=spec\">Brother HL-4040CDN</a>.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture%201.jpg\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"Picture 1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Picture 1\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture%201_thumb.jpg\" width=\"324\" height=\"244\" /></a> </p>  <p>Now you might be thinking “color laser printer” isn’t that overkill and/or really expensive.&#160; I first used a color laser printer in the mid-90s – the HP Color Laser Printer.&#160; It was terribly slow, needed a lot of maintenance, cost a ton to buy (close to $10,000) and the supplies were prohibitively expensive (~1.50/page).&#160; Needless to say this was not for home/personal use. Today this color laser printer is $279 and costs far less than an ink jet printer to operate, oh and it prints about 20 pages per minute.</p>  <p>I’ve had it less than a week now, so this is more about first impressions than a review/recommendation.</p>  <h2>My requirements</h2>  <p>What I need is something that I can print to every day, and that my family can print to every day, without having to worry about the correct paper being installed, the expensive photo ink being installed, and with less concern about the cost per page to print.</p>  <p>I am teaching some classes now, so I may need to print 20-40 pages on the way out the door, and copies of web pages and articles on the fly.&#160; The kids are writing a number of reports each week and similarly need to be able to print before taking off for the day or night.</p>  <p>In this, color is actually not a requirement, but is very nice to have.&#160; The problem with ink jet printers and color is that they are so expensive to run, and if you print a big enough image, they still come out wet and need to set a while before using.</p>  <h2>Pros</h2>  <ul>   <li>XP, Vista and Windows 7 drivers – local and network:&#160; This is very important for us because the kids have XP netbook computers, we have one Vista laptop, and my main machine is now Windows 7.&#160; XP and Vista drivers came on the disk, and Windows Update found Windows 7 drivers immediately (which was very nice).&#160; So now everyone is set up to print to the printer from wherever they are on the network. </li>    <li>Speed – 20 ppm, black and white or color.&#160; It might be just me, but I end up printing things right as I exit the door going somewhere.&#160; It is nice to know that I can do this and have the printouts ready by the time I get my shoes on.</li>    <li>High duty cycle – this is a workgroup/office class machine and is duty rated for thousands of pages per month. This is well more than we will use, but it is good to know.</li>    <li>Large sheet capacity (250).&#160; The bottom third of this unit is just a paper tray that can hold 250 pages – this is nice for big print jobs or just not to have to worry about it.</li>    <li>Long print life.&#160; The standard toner cartridges last from 2,500-1,500 pages, and the high capacity carts last 4,000-5,000 pages.&#160; Again, it seems like with the ink jet I am always changing carts and paper.</li>    <li>Duplex – this was not a requirement, but is very nice.&#160; Duplex means that I can print on both sides of a sheet of paper automatically. This saves paper, and is great for printing workbooks on 3-hole paper.&#160; Then I can take the sheets and bind them directly with the facing pages set up correctly.</li> </ul>  <h2>Cons</h2>  <ul>   <li>Size, weight – huge.&#160; Even when the Office Max guy de-boxed the thing with me it barely fit in my car.&#160; This thing is a monster and the box it comes in could be a kids play house.&#160; In case you think I am exaggerating, the carton size is 22.4&quot; x 24.6&quot; x 22.2&quot; and weighs 74lbs.&#160; The unit alone is 16.5&quot; x 18.7&quot; x 12.5&quot; and weighs 65lbs.</li> </ul>  <p>&#160;<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture%202.jpg\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"Picture 2\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Picture 2\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture%202_thumb.jpg\" width=\"404\" height=\"234\" /></a> </p>  <ul>   <li>Ethernet, but no wifi.&#160; Fortunately where I was going to put the printer was next to a network hub, but others may need to put it somewhere unwired.&#160; It should be a feature that could be added, but I don’t see that anywhere. </li>    <li>Features I won’t use, like direct USB printing of PDF, Jpeg, PictBridge.&#160; For the price and added tech to support these rather useless features I would have rather had WiFi.</li>    <li>Brother is not a known brand to me. Nothing really good or bad here, it is just a brand I have never dealt with.</li> </ul>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <h2>Impressions</h2>  <p>Overall I am really happy with the printer so far and will follow up in a few months with a longer term review.&#160; The kids used it over the weekend for different research projects and I am ready for class this week already.&#160; So far so good.</p>','Brother Color Laser Printer HL-4040CDN','','publish','open','open','','brother-color-laser-printer-hl-4040cdn','','','2009-09-20 23:43:12','2009-09-20 23:43:12','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Brother-Color-Laser-Printer-HL-4040CDN.aspx',0,'post','',2),(34,2,'2009-09-10 01:13:09','2009-09-10 01:13:09','<p>The last book on the Summer 2009 reading list was Fearless by Max Lucado. This book was very timely for me and was a nice break from technical and fiction books. Fearless is a book by author and pastor Max Lucado out of San Antonio which attempts (and succeeds in my opinion) to counter all the negativity and spirit of fear in seemingly all the headlines today.</p>  <p>What\'s to be afraid of? This week kids are going back to school (scary to start with), and they\'ll have to face H1N1 swine flu. There is political controversy on the first day with a live speech being presented by the president. Michigan has 15% unemployment so one or two kids at the bus stop has a parent that is looking for a job. A look at the headlines just for today will show issues on Health Care, Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Recession, Bankruptcy, Climate Change, Car Accidents, Nuclear Power, Infidelity, Death, Fallen Leaders, Vaccine Issues, Truck Bomb, Texas Execution, Plane Hijacked in Mexico, and more - but there is a cool new iPod nano (sigh).</p>  <p>I started reading Fearless with high expectations, having really enjoyed past books by Lucado, and was really surprised - in a good way. This is one of the rare books that I read, and then want to read again with someone else or with a group of people and discuss over coffee and maybe a donut. It may be one of the best books he has written, and I already know a few people who I want to get a copy of the book.</p>  <p>Fearless is really a book about overcoming fear. Fear is not the spirit that we are supposed to have, but instead one of power, love and self-control. Lucado explains that fear comes about as we perceive a loss of control in our lives. It is faith, not fear, that should be our reaction when these challenges come.</p>  <p>Lucado uses an amazing variety of styles in the book to illustrate very common fears among us - fears like not mattering to people, protecting your kids, challenges, violence, death, and others. In one chapter he uses a &quot;Dr. Seussian&quot; style poem to tell the story of the people of &quot;Stiltsville&quot;. In another chapter he will tell the true story, with detail and insight that few authors can accomplish, of his experience flying in an F-16 on maneuvers. Some of the ideas are common sense such as focusing on today, not worrying about yesterday or tomorrow - do the next thing. He takes an amusing tour through &quot;Worst Case Scenarios&quot; (i.e. surviving an Octopus attack) but brings the reader back to focusing on faith, peace and hope instead of falling into fear and doubt.</p>  <p>Overall I was very pleased by reading Fearless and recommend checking it out or picking up a copy for a friend who needs a lift.</p>','Fearless by Max Lucado','','publish','open','open','','fearless-by-max-lucado','','','2009-09-10 01:13:09','2009-09-10 01:13:09','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Fearless-by-Max-Lucado.aspx',0,'post','',0),(35,2,'2009-08-04 05:56:41','2009-08-04 05:56:41','<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Programming for Today’s Kids:</span> <em>Why NXT-G, Kodu, Scratch, Alice, Small Basic, KPL / Phrogram and others can reignite the imagination and understanding of technology for today’s kids.</em></strong>\r\n\r\nAs Kids growing up in the 70s and 80s, we did not have all the technical resources available to us as they do today.  Computers were rare, under-powered, and very difficult to use. Hand-held calculators weren’t even widely available, no public Internet, 3 TV channels, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWhat we did have was an accessible programming language that came with most computers: BASIC.  In fact, there wasn’t even much software that you could buy for your computer.  You had to write your own, and the language and environment was built-in to the machine.  A little later came LOGO, and even later came HyperCard for the Macintosh.  So for a kid with access to a computer, and a little interest, motivation, and summer break, you could spend hours programming and creating basic games with text, graphics and even sound.\r\n\r\nIronically, with all the advances in 30 years we have largely lost the entry-level development environment that kids can experiment and get started with.  Sure there are free tools for .NET, Java, PHP, etc. but they start at a much higher level and have so many commands and options that it is easy to get confused.  What kids need is a “level 0” or “level 1” type environment that is limited but easy to use (and did I mention fun?).\r\n\r\nNot every kid needs to learn to write complex programs.  But a generation of kids growing up without even a basic knowledge of how computer programs are written make them unaware of how things work and end up victims or slaves of the very technology that is meant to help them.\r\n\r\nSo for the last 4-5 years I’ve been on an active search for current options for kids who are even mildly interested in programming.  They need to be risk-free (i.e. kids can play around with them without damaging anything), fun (no kid-assembly language primers here), and have the ability to scale to average homes.\r\n\r\nI have made no conclusions here, but I wanted to list the environments I am using and “tracking” currently.  We started the “Bots on the Rock” robotics club in January 2008 and that has been doing well with kids 8-15.  In just the last month I started using Kodu on the XBox 360 at home, and now on the PC with the idea of using that with the club as well.  I am going to do a quick listing of what’s available, with more details to follow.\r\n<h2>Kodu: Game Programming Lab (XBox 360, PC (in Beta)) – 400 XBox “points”</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/kodu.jpg\"><img style=\"display: inline;

Hand-held calculators weren’t even widely available, no public Internet, 3 TV channels, etc., etc.\n\nWhat we did have was an accessible programming language that came with most computers: BASIC.  In fact, there wasn’t even much software that you could buy for your computer.  You had to write your own, and the language and environment was built-in to the machine.  A little later came LOGO, and even later came HyperCard for the Macintosh.  So for a kid with access to a computer, and a little interest, motivation, and summer break, you could spend hours programming and creating basic games with text, graphics and even sound.\n\nIronically, with all the advances in 30 years we have largely lost the entry-level development environment that kids can experiment and get started with.  Sure there are free tools for .NET, Java, PHP, etc. but they start at a much higher level and have so many commands and options that it is easy to get confused.  What kids need is a “level 0” or “level 1” type environment that is limited but easy to use (and did I mention fun?).\n\nNot every kid needs to learn to write complex programs.  But a generation of kids growing up without even a basic knowledge of how computer programs are written make them unaware of how things work and end up victims or slaves of the very technology that is meant to help them.\n\nSo for the last 4-5 years I’ve been on an active search for current options for kids who are even mildly interested in programming.  They need to be risk-free (i.e. kids can play around with them without damaging anything), fun (no kid-assembly language primers here), and have the ability to scale to average homes.\n\nI have made no conclusions here, but I wanted to list the environments I am using and “tracking” currently.  We started the “Bots on the Rock” robotics club in January 2008 and that has been doing well with kids 8-15.  In just the last month I started using Kodu on the XBox 360 at home, and now on the PC with the idea of using that with the club as well.  I am going to do a quick listing of what’s available, with more details to follow.\n<h2>Kodu: Game Programming Lab (XBox 360, PC (in Beta)) – 400 XBox “points”</h2>\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/kodu.jpg\"><img style=\"display: inline;

Find a four stakes to mark off the playing area, and we&rsquo;ve got a Kubb set.</p>\r\n<p>Over the 4th of July weekend I saw a guy selling Kubb sets at a craft show for $45 a set.&nbsp; My first thought was to buy a set, but my second thought was about our new written budget and that wouldn&rsquo;t work.&nbsp; I looked at the set closely and thought that it wouldn&rsquo;t take too much effort to make one of these at home.&nbsp; When plans changed for camp this week, I thought it might be a fun activity for us to try to make a set at home.&nbsp; The result was quite successful.</p>\r\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\r\n<p>Here is a pic and a <a href=\"http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/mirror/kubb.pdf\">PDF of the basic instructions</a> for what we did.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/mirror/kubb.pdf\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"KubbPlans\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/KubbPlans.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"KubbPlans\" width=\"470\" height=\"368\" /></a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/kubbfinal.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"Kubb Final Set\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/kubbfinal_thumb.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Kubb Final Set\" width=\"470\" height=\"350\" /></a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/wood.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"wood\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/wood_thumb.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"wood\" width=\"154\" height=\"260\" align=\"right\" /></a> The first thing to remember is that Kubb sets vary quite a bit.&nbsp; Some use round/cylinder pieces, some use squared off pieces, and the sizes vary quite a bit.&nbsp; Sure there are the <a href=\"http://www.vmkubb.com/rules/english.pdf\">World Championship Rules</a> if you want exact dimensions. But since they are in meters, cm and even mm, and my stores (and measuring tape) do not use metric, I used English measurements.&nbsp; My plans (above) are within 97% of the &ldquo;official&rdquo; rules and are probably much more practical for home use.</p>\r\n<h2>Wood</h2>\r\n<p>A word about which wood to use.&nbsp; Online and crafty sets come in pine, oak, cedar, ash and even more fancy woods.&nbsp; Pine is the easiest to find, cheapest, and easiest to cut and work with &ndash; this is what I picked.&nbsp; After playing a few games you will see that the Kubbs and sticks will get a few small dents and pick up some grass stains.&nbsp; For me this just shows some character and wearing of a fun game and doesn&rsquo;t impact the play at all &ndash; a few &ldquo;battle scars&rdquo; make the game even more fun.&nbsp; If this would bug you, buy harder wood and finish with some polyurethane.</p>\r\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\r\n<p>You can make a basic Kubb set with just the wood described in the plans and a miter saw / box.&nbsp; Just cut the King and Kubbs from the 4x4 and cut the dowels to size.&nbsp; You will have a fully usable and fun Kubb set then with about 20 cuts on the wood you bought home &ndash; done.&nbsp; You will need 4 stakes/sticks to mark the corners of the playing area, and you are off.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/kubbs.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px\" title=\"kubbs\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/kubbs_thumb.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"kubbs\" width=\"227\" height=\"260\" align=\"left\" /></a>If you want to take it one more step, you can cut down the Kubbs so that they are 2 3/4&rdquo; x 2 3/4&rdquo; x 6&rdquo;.&nbsp; This makes them a little &ldquo;leaner&rdquo; than the King.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll need a table saw to do this, and of course my simple one will not cut all the way through a 4x4.&nbsp; This ended up being the most work (and mess) of our whole project, and 3 1/2&rdquo; x 3 1/2&rdquo; x 6&rdquo; Kubbs probably work just fine.</p>\r\n<p>The final/finishing step is putting a quick crown on the King to make him look a little more important.&nbsp; This could easily be done with some paint or even a Sharpie (or skipped altogether).&nbsp; I cut a double-V on both faces of the top for a simple crown and a little v-shaped notch on each side for the &ldquo;neck&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>We sanded the sides of the Kubbs and sticks as they are handled by the players (don&rsquo;t want scratches or splinters).&nbsp; We have a bucket that they fit in nicely but I am looking for a canvas or drawstring back to store and transport the set.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"clear:both;\">Conclusions</h2>\r\n<p>In the end I am very happy with the result.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve played two games and it is quite fun.&nbsp; The rules sound a little complicated to start but after playing through two games we&rsquo;ve all figured it out.&nbsp; If you search for &ldquo;Kubb in sand&rdquo; or even &ldquo;Kubb in snow&rdquo; you will actually find results.&nbsp; A fun, outdoor, 4-season game is rare and this is very useful (especially in Michigan).&nbsp; Let me know if you make your own set or think of other ways to customize your set.</p>','Homemade Kubb Set Plans and Report','','publish','open','open','','homemade-kubb-set-plans-and-report','','','2009-07-18 04:32:00','2009-07-18 04:32:00','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Homemade-Kubb-Set-Plans-and-Report.aspx',0,'post','',1),(41,2,'2009-06-29 18:30:10','2009-06-29 18:30:10','<ul class=\'diigo-linkroll\'><li><p class=\'diigo-link\'><a rel=\'nofollow\' href=\'http://news.softpedia.com/news/Dell-Latitude-2100-Netbook-Sold-in-More-Than-500-US-School-Districts-115376.shtml\'>Dell Latitude 2100 Netbook Sold in More Than 500 US School Districts - Dell sees successful launch of Atom-based netbook - Softpedia</a></p><p class=\'diigo-tags\'><a style=\'color:#000 !important;text-decoration:none !important;\' href=\'http://www.diigo.com/cloud/babernethy\'>tags</a>: <a href=\'http://www.diigo.com/user/babernethy/2100\'>2100</a>, <a href=\'http://www.diigo.com/user/babernethy/netbook\'>netbook</a></p><li><p class=\'diigo-link\'><a rel=\'nofollow\' href=\'http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/post/Dell-Latitude-2100.aspx\'>Dell Latitude 2100 “kidbook” - Detailed First Impressions and Tips</a></p><p class=\'diigo-description\'>Getting some good feedback on the Dell 2100 blog post - may need to write a second one with updates and more info.</p><p class=\'diigo-tags\'><a style=\'color:#000 !important;text-decoration:none !important;\' href=\'http://www.diigo.com/cloud/babernethy\'>tags</a>: <a href=\'http://www.diigo.com/user/babernethy/no_tag\'>no_tag</a></p><li><p class=\'diigo-link\'><a rel=\'nofollow\' href=\'http://www.polleverywhere.com/\'>Text Message (SMS) Polls and Voting, Audience Response System       | Poll Everywhere</a></p><p class=\'diigo-description\'>Interesting Ruby app to use Polls in presentations and other areas where audience can use cell phones, Twitter or the web to vote on active questions.</p><p class=\'diigo-tags\'><a style=\'color:#000 !important;text-decoration:none !important;\' href=\'http://www.diigo.com/cloud/babernethy\'>tags</a>: <a href=\'http://www.diigo.com/user/babernethy/no_tag\'>no_tag</a></p><li><p class=\'diigo-link\'><a rel=\'nofollow\' href=\'http://www.neccunplugged.com\'>neccunplugged - home</a></p><p class=\'diigo-description\'>Online from NECC for those of us who can\'t be there to see this exciting conference for those involved with Educational Technology</p><p class=\'diigo-tags\'><a style=\'color:#000 !important;text-decoration:none !important;\' href=\'http://www.diigo.com/cloud/babernethy\'>tags</a>: <a href=\'http://www.diigo.com/user/babernethy/no_tag\'>no_tag</a></p><li><p class=\'diigo-link\'><a rel=\'nofollow\' href=\'http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick\'>Sugar on a Stick - Sugar Labs</a></p><p class=\'diigo-description\'>May be a way to try out the Sugar / XO OS on a netbook.</p><p class=\'diigo-tags\'><a style=\'color:#000 !important;text-decoration:none !important;\' href=\'http://www.diigo.com/cloud/babernethy\'>tags</a>: <a href=\'http://www.diigo.com/user/babernethy/no_tag\'>no_tag</a></p><li><p class=\'diigo-link\'><a rel=\'nofollow\' href=\'http://www.diigo.com/index\'>Diigo - Web Highlighter and Sticky Notes, Social Bookmarking and Annotation, Social Information Network!</a><span class=\'diigo-link-opts\'> - <a href=\'http://www.diigo.com/annotated?uid=457150&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.diigo.com%2Findex\'>Annotated</a></span></p><p class=\'diigo-description\'>Interesting tool for finding and sharing links</p><p class=\'diigo-tags\'><a style=\'color:#000 !important;text-decoration:none !important;\' href=\'http://www.diigo.com/cloud/babernethy\'>tags</a>: <a href=\'http://www.diigo.com/user/babernethy/no_tag\'>no_tag</a></p></ul><br />Posted from <a href=\'http://www.diigo.com\'>Diigo</a>.

Also, the bottom of the unit has no access points for memory or drives, etc.&nbsp; In fact if you even remove the four screws on the access panel it will not come off &ndash; there are three more screw under the keyboard (see below) that need to be removed to access the hardware. This adds a nice level of security from interested eyes, but adds some complexity of adding memory, etc.&nbsp; Interestingly this also means that desktop spills could avoid damage as there are no access holes or vents on the bottom surface.&nbsp; The 6-cell battery option raises up the base even more for additional clearance.</p>\r\n<p>The 2100 is a barebones and utility machine.&nbsp; It is not a tablet (though we did get the touch screen, see below), there is no thumb scanner, or firewire ports (3 USB).&nbsp; The keyboard is solid and nearly full sized, but there are no multimedia keys other than volume/mute controls.&nbsp; Did I mention there is no CD/DVD drive &ndash; typical for a netbook, but still something to get used to from desktops and laptops.</p>\r\n<p>Finally the 2100 is very budget conscious &ndash; starting under $400, about $450 with the additional memory, touch screen, and webcam on these units.&nbsp; I remember in 1991 when I was teaching computers and we got some Apple PowerBook 100s to pilot with some teachers and students.&nbsp; These were $2,500 each in 1991 money.&nbsp; Even the Newton-PDA inspired eMate 300 device was $799 in 1997 and didn&rsquo;t even run &ldquo;real&rdquo; software.&nbsp; The netbooks are finally a device that has enough power at a reasonable price for 1:1 student use.</p>\r\n<h2>Screen</h2>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get right to my biggest concern about the units the screen resolution - 1024 x 574?&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; Computer monitors have traditionally been in a 4:3 ratio (e.g. 640x480, 800x600) and more recently 16:9 (1280x720) but netbooks have commonly chosen WSVGA resolution of 1024x600.&nbsp; This is trouble enough as it doesn&rsquo;t match any typical resolutions of monitors, but by the 2100 dropping a mysterious 26 pixels off of this causes additional problems.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/screenres.png\"><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px\" title=\"screenres\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/screenres_thumb.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"screenres\" width=\"404\" height=\"324\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Many web sites are expecting at least 700 pixel vertical resolution, so you end up having to scroll down to get to the active parts of many web sites.&nbsp; But this is true of all netbooks and web sites are adapting to the netbook trend.</p>\r\n<p>However, software installers can check minimum resolution before installing or setting themselves up.&nbsp; Some software will see a vertical resolution of under 600 and set up for 640x480 which makes an awkward little box in the middle of the relatively big screen.&nbsp; Others will not install without at least 800x600 resolution.&nbsp; To get around this you can temporarily change your screen resolution to 1024x768.&nbsp; This means you end up scrolling the screen up and down to see the full screen by moving the mouse up and down.&nbsp; This will allow the software to install.&nbsp; Then you can change the resolution back and the software will typically run (may clip the bottom a little).</p>\r\n<p>But, 1024x576 is not one of the choices in the typical &ldquo;Display Properties&rdquo; dialog box &ndash; so how do you switch back.&nbsp; It turns out it is not that straightforward, but here is the scoop.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/06graphics.png\"><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px;

Settings, choose the Advanced Button.&nbsp; One of the Tabs will now be called &ldquo;Intel Graphics Media Accelerator Driver for Mobile&rdquo;.&nbsp; Here there are two things: 1) the button that takes you to the actual screen you need, and 2) a &ldquo;Show Tray Icon&rdquo; checkbox that will enable access to this panel directly from the System Tray.&nbsp; If you find yourself needing to switch resolutions to support certain software, having easy access to his panel will be helpful.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/06bintel2.png\"><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px;

resolution of the 2100 (1024x576).</p>\r\n<p>An additional tip, the new Chrome web browser from Google has a unique functionality (that I hope gets picked up by IE, Firefox, etc.) that allows you to find a page on the web and then &ldquo;Create Application Shortcuts&rdquo;. This does two important things: 1) Drops an icon on the desktop, start menu, quick-launch bar, etc. for that web site (and picks up the favicon as an icon for the shortcut) and 2) removes all the UI chrome at the top (i.e. no address bar, tabs, menus, just the window title).&nbsp; This enables kids to get to pre-selected sites very quickly and maximizes the vertical &ldquo;real estate&rdquo; on the screen for maximum use.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/09chromewikipedia.png\"><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px\" title=\"09chromewikipedia\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/09chromewikipedia_thumb.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"09chromewikipedia\" width=\"404\" height=\"246\" /></a></p>\r\n<h2>Touch Screen</h2>\r\n<p>I opted for the touch screen because I am developing some software that uses it, but I was surprised at how the kids started using this feature right away in many of the applications.&nbsp; The kids must not have the hang-ups I have about touching a screen to get it to do things because they use it all the time.&nbsp; In fact in some software like Rosetta Stone (foreign language &ndash; nice) it is much more instinctive and natural to use the touch screen than maneuver with the touchpad.&nbsp; Not much more to say about this yet &ndash; I am eager to get some software going that will use it even more.</p>\r\n<h2>CPU</h2>\r\n<p>The 2100 uses the common combination of the Intel Atom N2170 CPU and Intel 950 GMA (graphics media accelerator).&nbsp; This combination does a very respectable job of running most software very well.</p>\r\n<p>The notable exception is software that requires significant graphics memory and 3D acceleration.&nbsp; Two failures in this regard were Age of Empires III and Civilization IV.&nbsp; A general rule, if you considered buying a new video card to run a game or program, then it will probably have issues on a netbook</p>\r\n<p>The 2100 plays video well (avi, mov, mp4, and even DVDs, see below), but don\'t expect to record or edit videos on the machine itself.&nbsp; The performance was very respectable with photos (even large ones) consider the higher-end (2Gb) of memory if editing and manipulating images will be important..</p>\r\n<h2>Integrated Camera / Microphone</h2>\r\n<p>We also opted for the integrated webcam and digital microphone.&nbsp; I was very pleased when installing Skype (video conferencing) at how well it worked with the hardware with the standard install.&nbsp; The device comes with software for basic webcam recording and still picture capture.</p>\r\n<p>The one trick we found was actually enabling the integrated digital microphone in applications like Skype and Audacity (audio/podcasting).&nbsp; There is only one microphone driver/input in the software but there is an external jack for microphones and an internal digital microphone.&nbsp; I only found one place to switch between the two.&nbsp; If you open the control panels there will be one called the &ldquo;Realtek HD Sound Effect Manager&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/07sound.png\"><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px\" title=\"07sound\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/07sound_thumb.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"07sound\" width=\"404\" height=\"207\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Opening this up you will find a tab called &ldquo;Mixer&rdquo;.&nbsp; Once selected you will have the option to select the radio button for either the external or integrated/digital mic.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/07adigmic.png\"><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px\" title=\"07adigmic\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/07adigmic_thumb.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"07adigmic\" width=\"404\" height=\"287\" /></a></p>\r\n<h2>Memory</h2>\r\n<p>There are really four configurations of memory in the 2100: 512Mb, 1Gb, 1.5Gb, and 2Gb.&nbsp; The interesting thing is that the initial memory configuration is very important.&nbsp; The first 512Mb or 1Gb of memory is actually permanent on the motherboard of the laptop &ndash; that is, it can&rsquo;t be removed or upgraded.&nbsp; There is one slot for memory that can take an additional 1Gb of memory.&nbsp; So starting with 1Gb maximizes your memory potential.&nbsp; This is how I ordered the units because additional memory was $29 for 2 1Gb DIMMs online (and I was over budget because of the touch screen and webcam already).</p>\r\n<p>Adding the second sticks of memory turns out to be more involved than any laptop I have ever used or owned, and this is saying a lot.&nbsp; It turns out that you first need to remove the keyboard (2 screws) to get to the internal screws attaching the bottom cover (3 screws) and then you need to remove the bottom access cover (4 screws).&nbsp; One note here is to be careful with the keyboard cable clip.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/02akeyclip.png\"><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px\" title=\"02akeyclip\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/02akeyclip_thumb.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"02akeyclip\" width=\"260\" height=\"159\" /></a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This clip opens upwards (see above) and stays attached &ndash; or should stay attached.&nbsp; One one of the units I had this clip (the white part) completely detach which lead to 20 minutes or so of anxiety before my wife (with better eyes and smaller fingers) got the clip to click back on (thanks Laura).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/02bkeygone.png\"><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px;

correctly so I had to re-remove the 9 screws, keyboard, panel, etc. and do it all over again &ndash; good experience, but, again, not as &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; as many other laptops.&nbsp; Perhaps having Dell install the 1Gb when building the machine is worth saving $10 on memory.</p>\r\n<p>On the plus side, this really keeps curious kids from getting into the device (it&rsquo;d be nice if you could get a replacement set of outer screws that were Torx or at least not Phillips-head screws to slow them down even more.&nbsp; On the down side this makes a typically easy memory upgrade a much more involved task.</p>\r\n<h2>Operating System</h2>\r\n<p>Ubuntu Linux, Windows XP SP3, or Windows 7 &ndash; not considering Vista as a practical option right now.</p>\r\n<p>This is actually a pretty easy decision for us. Linux won\'t run most of the educational software (out of emulation). Likewise Windows 7 won\'t run much of the software and &ldquo;Virtual XP&rdquo; mode is not supported on Atom processors.</p>\r\n<p>Macintosh OSX not available on non-Apple equipment - will Apple release a netbook / kidbook?</p>\r\n<p>So Windows XP SP3 is probably the most stable and understood Windows operating system in use (since Windows 98SE) and runs the important software we use.&nbsp; Microsoft has stated that the XP downgrade option will be available for 18 months after the release of Windows 7, after that a CPU and memory upgrade will probably be necessary to achieve similar results.</p>\r\n<h2>Networking</h2>\r\n<p>Unsurprisingly the 2100 supports Wi-Fi and wired connections (no 3G or WiMax, but not needed).&nbsp; But surprisingly it supports 802.11n high-speed Wi-Fi and 1000 Gigabit Ethernet wired connections which are not common on typical netbooks.&nbsp; They also have the ability to &ldquo;wake on LAN&rdquo; which enables solutions like the upcoming &ldquo;Managed Mobile Computing Station&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/09mobilestation.png\"><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px\" title=\"09mobilestation\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/09mobilestation_thumb.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"09mobilestation\" width=\"244\" height=\"244\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This unit enables 24 of the 2100s to be docked for charging, storage/security, and remote updates (even includes it&rsquo;s own wireless router so you can plug in one Ethernet cable and wirelessly power a room).&nbsp; But at close to $4,000 this kind of kills the whole &ldquo;on budget&rdquo; theme for a classroom &ndash; hmm, 10 more 2100s or a fancy cart.</p>\r\n<p>Bluetooth 2.1 is available as an added option (we didn&rsquo;t opt-in).&nbsp; This was tempting for use with the LEGO Mindstorms NXT robotics kits, or wireless mouse, but I can imagine the pairing and management of a classroom full of Bluetooth devices could get challenging.</p>\r\n<p>One other thing is the somewhat hyped feature of the Network Activity Light.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/10activitylight.png\"><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px\" title=\"10activitylight\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/10activitylight_thumb.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"10activitylight\" width=\"252\" height=\"153\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>This is included on the cover of the netbook and shows if any network interface is being used (i.e. light on if activity, light off if no activity).&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stop short of calling this a &ldquo;gimmick&rdquo; but in our experience the light is always on because the network is always on.&nbsp; If there were an easier way for kids to turn the network on and off, or some software uses this for other purposes (a promised API from Dell for educational software programmers may be coming soon), then this may have a larger use and impact.</p>\r\n<h2>Battery</h2>\r\n<p>Dell offers a 3-cell and 6-cell battery for the 2100.&nbsp; The 6-cell adds a little bit of height but is barely noticeable.&nbsp; One unique feature is that there is a clear plastic &ldquo;window&rdquo; on the battery where you can slide in a strip of paper with a particular student&rsquo;s name (or other identifier) on the unit.&nbsp; This gives a clear way to identify different machines in what may be a crowded classroom situation.</p>\r\n<h2>Keyboard</h2>\r\n<p>The keyboard is nearly full-sized and I had no time with my huge hands typing e-mail and other tests.&nbsp; Another unique option here is an antimicrobial protected keyboard option. In a shared environment could be a real plus with the flu and colds going around.&nbsp; For 1:1 use this may not be as much of a benefit (did not opt for this either).</p>\r\n<h2>CD-DVD Options / Issues</h2>\r\n<p>Sometimes there is no getting away from using external media.&nbsp; Ironically all the backup and recovery software for the 2100 comes on CD, which you can&rsquo;t ever access from the 2100 directly.&nbsp; Also, some curriculums include physical DVDs (e.g. One Year Adventure Novel) and others have a lot of media that needs to be accessed from the disc (e.g. Rosetta Stone language software).&nbsp; In these cases you have two options.</p>\r\n<p>The first is an external CD/DVD drive.&nbsp; The best of these will require no external power and can be powered directly from the USB port.&nbsp; Dell has an option for this when building the machines for $90 which includes PowerDVD (playing DVDs) and Roxio Creator software (burning discs).&nbsp; I was watching for deals and found a Samsung drive on sale at NewEgg for $49 which included Nero 8 (playing and burning).&nbsp; This has worked well for installing software, running CDs, and playing DVDs &ndash; I was impressed that the laptop played the DVDs so well with the limited power.&nbsp; I am sure when you are running off of battery power that this would significantly reduce battery run time.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/04drives.png\"><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px\" title=\"04drives\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/04drives_thumb.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"04drives\" width=\"420\" height=\"244\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>The other option is to use disc images on the hard drive.&nbsp; Utilities such as PowerISO will allow you to create an image of most CDs/DVDs and store them on the hard drive, and later mount these images as virtual disks.&nbsp; This essentially mirrors the content of the CD/DVD to the hard drive.&nbsp; This image can then be run using just the hard drive.&nbsp; This raises all kinds of copyright issues and licensing headaches.&nbsp; This is a topic for another post, but make sure your licensing allows for this type of use and that you are covered for the number of simultaneous installs and users that you have. Some discs have copy protection on them and will not work with this method of mounting &ndash; this clearly shows the intent of the publisher &ndash; contact them directly as I am sure this will be a common issue going forward.</p>\r\n<p>Ideally software will move away from distribution by disc, and even installing locally on the netbook at all (more below on this).&nbsp; But until then there are still options for curriculum that is distributed and/or must run with a disc.</p>\r\n<h2>Pros</h2>\r\n<p>Marketing material is one thing, but a well designed &ldquo;kidbook&rdquo; is worth lauding.&nbsp; If I haven&rsquo;t mentioned it before I am in no way associated with Dell and don&rsquo;t get any compensation from them.&nbsp; That being said, I really do like the 2100s.&nbsp; They are solid and do what they claim to do, and don&rsquo;t do what they don&rsquo;t claim to do.&nbsp; The price point is quite reasonable considering the power and functionality provided.&nbsp; Unique options like the touch screen, anti-swine flu keyboard, rubberized and secured exterior, etc. are very nice to see.&nbsp; The touch screen and web cam enable more &ldquo;natural user interface&rdquo; options that enable use of the 2100 beyond the keyboard and mouse/touchpad.</p>\r\n<h2>Cons</h2>\r\n<p>The biggest &ldquo;con&rdquo; is the screen resolution (1024x576).&nbsp; I would predict that this gets a remedy fairly quickly because of the non-trivial impact that it can and will have on software installs and execution.&nbsp; Unfortunately early adopters will be somewhat left behind by this &ndash; but that is one of the risks of being early to any technology.</p>\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n<p>When I was young and foolish I leased a 1995 Dodge Cirrus based on a popular consumer\'s magazine \"Car of the Year\" award (because I had finished my Masters degree, and had a full time school administrator\'s job, and \"deserved\" a new car).&nbsp; I only mention this because it was the worst car I have ever owned, recalled twice, in the shop for mechanical failures 5 times, and all in the 24 months of the lease.&nbsp; This is/was the last new car I ever bought and I learned an expensive lesson about cost and value (and how leasing is 95% of the time a terrible option).&nbsp; I also learned not to give or trust recommendations without a significant amount of hands-on time for new models.&nbsp; Interestingly the said consumer magazine has also adopted a similar policy for new models.</p>\r\n<p>And you probably realize where this is going - I am going to hold off on recommendations concerning the Dell 2100 until we\'ve spent some real-world time using it.&nbsp; Unfortunately models change so fast with computers that waiting a year to make a recommendation will probably find the Dell 2115 in production with the first or second round of enhancements.&nbsp; But I am in no way sending them back, and am cautiously optimistic that these will really be helpful going forward. I am also realistic that there will be improvements (1024x576) and tweaks and being on the cutting edge is exciting but sometimes you get a little cut up in the process.</p>\r\n<p>Overall I&rsquo;d give the 2100 &ldquo;4 of 5 stars&rdquo; or a solid B+, which means there is a little room for improvement but it is a solid offering and unique today in the marketplace.</p>\r\n<h2>Products Installed / Mentioned Here</h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Rosetta Stone</strong> (Language Learning) <a href=\"http://www.rosettastone.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.rosettastone.com/</a> </li>\r\n<li><strong>Skype</strong> (Audio/Video Calls/Conference) <a href=\"http://www.skype.com/\">http://www.skype.com/</a> </li>\r\n<li><strong>Lego Mindstorms NXT</strong> (Robotics) <a href=\"http://mindstorms.lego.com/eng/Egypt_dest/Default.aspx\">http://mindstorms.lego.com/eng/Egypt_dest/Default.aspx</a> AND <a href=\"http://www.legoeducation.com\">http://www.legoeducation.com</a> </li>\r\n<li><strong>Teaching Textbooks</strong> (Math, 4th-Pre-Calc) <a href=\"http://www.teachingtextbooks.com/\">http://www.teachingtextbooks.com/</a> </li>\r\n<li><strong>PowerISO</strong> (create/mount disc images) <a href=\"http://www.poweriso.com/\">http://www.poweriso.com/</a> </li>\r\n<li><strong>One Year Adventure Novel</strong> (Writing 8th+) <a href=\"http://www.oneyearnovel.com/\">http://www.oneyearnovel.com/</a> </li>\r\n<li><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org\">http://www.wikipedia.org</a> </li>\r\n<li><strong>Google Chrome</strong> (web browser) <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\">http://www.google.com/chrome</a>&nbsp; </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Implications</h2>\r\n<p>This is already 2 or 3 times the size of a good blog post, but I plan to add another post at some point about the implications of netbooks in the marketplace.&nbsp; Some technology analysts predict that in 5 years 50% of internet connected computers will be netbooks. Software and services targeting (or at least supporting) netbooks will be an important market.&nbsp; Software distributed via the network, or better yet delivered in real-time over the network, will be in demand.&nbsp; Also, software that can adapt to the screen size of the user (from 10&rdquo; netbook to 30&rdquo; desktop monitor) will be popular to enable use and features based on the power and size of the particular install.&nbsp; Some examples of recent posts on products of this type are below.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have to also post some samples of what we are doing with Silverlight and dock panels and view boxes to show some of the latest technology to help enable functionality in installations on different screen resolutions.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://eeepc.net/netbook-office-suite-launched-by-corel/\">http://eeepc.net/netbook-office-suite-launched-by-corel/</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://eeepc.net/thinkfree-office-suite-available-for-purchase/\">http://eeepc.net/thinkfree-office-suite-available-for-purchase/</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Had to fix the URL \"slug\" it was messing things up (never include a quote in a slug).</p>','Dell Latitude 2100 “kidbook” - Detailed First Impressions and Tips','','publish','open','open','','dell-latitude-2100-%e2%80%9ckidbook%e2%80%9d-detailed-first-impressions-and-tips','','','2009-06-22 23:51:00','2009-06-22 23:51:00','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Dell-Latitude-2100.aspx',0,'post','',12),(43,2,'2009-06-15 06:04:01','2009-06-15 06:04:01','<p>NECC is the National Educational Computing Conference put on yearly by the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) (<a href=\"http://center.uoregon.edu/ISTE/NECC2009/\">http://center.uoregon.edu/ISTE/NECC2009/</a>).&#160; This is the group that sets national standards for technology in education, and brings together creative and intelligent speakers and attendees for a lively discussion each year.

In the short time I have used it in both environments I have been so pleased with it that it is worth noting.&#160; But I realized that most of the features and performance that have been so welcome, are mostly because of the corresponding disappointment with Vista.&#160; My overall impressions follow – technical tips for those installing the Release Candidate are at the end.</p>  <p>In the last three years I bought these two machines with Vista on them.&#160; Even though the specs on these machines were near the high-end of their category, both seemed to perform even slower that older XP machines when running as shipped with Vista.&#160; Both are HP machines and came with the typical demo-ware and expire-ware and general junk software that seems to come with all new machines now.&#160; I rebuilt them with Vista Ultimate x64 (laptop had 4Gb and desktop had 6Gb – wanted to access memory and CPU features) and had an immediate speed increase.&#160; But many of my USB devices would not work with Vista – and less would work with Vista x64.&#160; My printer, phone, and Bluetooth devices were all without drivers, so things wouldn’t work.&#160; Also, much of my 3rd party software would not work with Vista – utilities, anti-virus, and even development tools would not run or were restricted and stopped working because of Vista’s new “security” features.&#160; Even Microsoft software like office and Visual Studio seemed to conflict with Vista – don’t these people work together?&#160; Needless to say, I was nearing buyers remorse with both machines after their showing with Microsoft’s new flagship operating system.&#160; In fact, I passed up opportunities at work to move to Vista and kept working on Microsoft XP until early this year when my work PC was upgraded. </p>  <p>So fast-forward to May 2009 and the release of Windows 7 RC – a completely different experience.&#160; I installed the x64 version on my desktop and the x32 version on the laptop (just to see if x64 was still more of a pain).&#160; The install process was painless and fast and all of the devices on the desktop were found and compatible drivers were found.&#160; Windows 7 even correctly identified my two LCD monitors (one of which is really old) and set them for optimum resolution.&#160; Now boot-up is quicker, sleep actually works on the laptop (Vista sleep/hibernate is terrible), only 2-3 security prompts so far during installs, applications are running.&#160; Overall things seem really tight, fast, and stable.&#160; It is like Vista should have been.&#160; I can’t stress enough how dramatically different these two installations feel and perform. </p>  <p>Why the dramatic difference between these two seemingly similar operating systems?&#160; I think there are at least two reasons: 1) Time and 2) Damage Control.&#160; The immediate analogy to the “New Coke” fiasco in the 80s.&#160; Coke changed their long-time formula for Coke and spent a lot of money on marketing to convince people it tasted better than the old standard.&#160; Nobody bought it, and die-hard Coke fans revolted.&#160; It was a dark time and Coke seemed to be going down, but then the re-released “Coke Classic” and regained their market share and more.&#160; Vista really is Microsoft’s “New Coke”.</p>  <p>Microsoft has had time during the release of Vista to get all the technical bits worked out – the missing drivers, the UAC and data execution blocking issues, and software and hardware vendors have been able to come out with new versions of their software that are more compatible with the new underlying OS architecture.&#160; Remember, Windows 7 is really more like Vista SP3 with “extras” and “junk removed” – which is fine by me.&#160; Vista will get the blame for being so difficult to use and incompatible, but Windows 7 will get the credit simply by being years later in the game.&#160; Microsoft also has recently added the Virtual XP Mode to Windows 7, which is really a huge win for older software in corporate and educational installations where software has been orphaned and will not be updated.&#160; Vista also failed on the new category of netbook machines – small/cheap/portable laptops – where XP has been so popular.&#160; Windows 7 is much more performant on laptop devices.</p>  <p>As for damage control, Microsoft, like Coke, stepped back and looked at all the complaints of their best customers and realized that this wasn’t just “growing pains” and that they wouldn’t just “get used to it” and move on.&#160; These were significant and real problems that weren’t going away.&#160; So what could they remove from Vista that was the most glaring issues, and what could they add back to justify a new operating system.&#160; The combination of removing the most annoying problems of Vista, while adding significant features in, is really an operating system worth looking forward to.</p>  <p>In the end I think Windows 7 will be a big success for Microsoft – like I said, it is what Vista should have been.&#160; But if we all had to go through the pain of Vista to get to Windows 7, I think the short attention-span of consumers will quickly forget and move forward.&#160; Vista may join the ranks of Windows Me, Microsoft Bob, and other well-intentioned mistakes in the evolution of Windows OS.</p>  <p>Here are a few tips and details of what I have installed – in case this helps anyone.</p>  <ul>   <li>Mounting .iso images on Windows 7 - PowerISO is working to mount .iso files, Daemon Tools is not.</li>    <li>Virtual XP Mode is a set of separate downloads – not included with the base Windows 7 RC.&#160;

Wednesday last night.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is great to have regular events like this to bring people together and stimulate conversation and ideas - which is exactly what it did.<span>&nbsp; </span>Talks like this are inspirational and thought-provoking, but are really meant to start the conversation, not be the entire conversation.<span>&nbsp; </span>So this is my brief addition to what Kieth started last night. </font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n<font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">Before, I thought of creating a Lingo Bingo card for the talk as has been a fun trend (http://bingo.keynote.se/ ).<span>&nbsp; </span>So I scanned headlines for a large group of tech Blogs for common themes.<span>&nbsp; </span>You need 24 items for a complete Bingo card (middle is Free) so this is what I came up with:</font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n<font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">Nanobots, Netbook/OLPC, WiFi/3G/WiMAX, Wii, RFID, ePaper, Twitter/Facebook, Mobile/iPhone/Android, Robots, Cloud/Grid/Mesh Computing, Vision/Camera, Electric Cars / Car Tech, &quot;Hybrid&quot;, Home Servers, Google/Chrome, Hulu, Surface / Multi-touch, XBox Live, SSD, Netflix, 3D Entertainment, Electronic Marketplace, Green, Security/Privacy, GPS, SaS/SOA, Voice</font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n<font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Calibri\"><span>&nbsp;</span>If you were at the event you know what was discussed, if not check out http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2009/02/cyborgs_robotic_pets_on_the_ho.html for the high-level overview and the predictions.</font></font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n<font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">Keith&#39;s predictions that seem to have missed the mainstream ideas were the &quot;New Energy Source&quot; and the &quot;Role of the Elderly&quot;.<span>&nbsp; </span>The items from the &quot;lingo list&quot; that I was surprised missed the top 10 were anything Car/Automotive related, Home Servers, Green Tech, and 3D Entertainment.</font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n<font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">Two main themes or ideas have stuck with me that I think are actionable and could lead to new products or even businesses.<span>&nbsp; </span>They do not come out of any one of the trends but are rather a result of three or more all spun together.</font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n<font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">The first is the market that will be created when a majority of peoples&#39; personal computers are netbooks.<span>&nbsp; </span>Software running on netbooks is of a different character than many traditional mainline applications.<span>&nbsp; </span>First, it is not necessarily locally installed.<span>&nbsp; </span>netbooks have very limited local storage, less memory and potentially a bit smaller screen than a desktop or full laptop computer. Also, there is not typically a CD/DVD drive to load software onto the device - software is loaded and run from the network/Internet.<span>&nbsp; </span>That is, the software comes out of the Cloud, runs on the computer, and can then &quot;go away&quot;.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even data for the application can be stored in the Cloud.<span>&nbsp; </span>In theory, I could use one netbook one day and run all of my applications off of it.<span>&nbsp; </span>The next day I could run off of a completely different netbook (or computer or laptop) and the software and files would come out of the Cloud for me to use and run seamlessly.</font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n<font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">So first, what will not run in this environment?<span>&nbsp; </span>First, any big &quot;bloatware&quot; like Office 2007 where you need a big disk and a lot of memory just to write a Word document.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plus a retail version is 100s of dollars and out of the reach of most people.<span>&nbsp; </span>Cutting edge 3D games will not have the local power and speed to run in this environment.<span>&nbsp; </span>Video-authoring and editing software will have issues with local storage and resources.<span>&nbsp; </span>Anything that runs off of a CD/DVD, like most current Educational software.</font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n<font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">What will be useful and popular on netbooks? First, web applications.<span>&nbsp; </span>Google has a huge lead on this area and will benefit greatly from that.<span>&nbsp; </span>From e-mail, to documents, to calendars, to news readers, Google has applications that will work today on netbooks.<span>&nbsp; </span>Beyond this they have a way to make money from the applications through advertising and eCommerce solutions.</font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n<font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">Beyond web applications is a layer of Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) which have traditionally run on Adobe Flash and are also now arriving via Adobe AIR for out-of-browser applications and via Silverlight for rich media and line-of-business applications.<span>&nbsp; </span>A market for small and targeted applications is already here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Stores like Apples iTunes App store or the new Dell Downloads service can enable authors of software to have a marketplace for their new portable applications.<span>&nbsp; </span>These applications come right from the store, run on the device, and can &quot;go away&quot; just as quickly when their usefulness is done.<span>&nbsp; </span>The ability for a company to quickly develop, test, and distribute small targeted applications will become a very valuable skill set.</font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n<font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">Combining the netbook technologies with the reviving Educational Technology craze could open an even bigger market with built-in funding through economic stimulus funds and local taxation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Imagine a &quot;ruggedized&quot; version of a netbook with built-in GPS tracking (don&#39;t want to have these get lost or &quot;walk away&quot;).<span>&nbsp; </span>A $300 ruggedized netbook could see the one-child per computer (OLPC) vision of many educationalists become a reality.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some textbook providers will (and are) provide a digital equivalent of their current offerings.<span>&nbsp; </span>But a market for niche software that extends and broadens the possible offerings for different students will be huge.<span>&nbsp; </span>Imagine a modern physics lesson and simulator or Spanish language tutor or even a MindMapping solution.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even if all an author got was $.99 per student, this could amount to millions of dollars very quickly (and would still be cheaper than textbooks cost now).</font>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 10pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n<font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\">Once we have an education-optimized netbook it doesn&#39;t take long to consider a business-optimized or health-care optimized netbook/tablet.<span>&nbsp; </span>These devices will have the same benefits and restrictions.

CodeMash is about learning from others, interacting with others, and really following the personal flow of what is important and interesting to an individual.&#160; </p>  <p>There is also the opportunity to attend and even present in the Open Spaces area of the conference.&#160; This is where impromptu presentations and discussions happen around topics that are of interest to the people that are there at the moment, and the content and timing of these sessions can not be predicted in advance.&#160; It is a weird idea if someone is used to just being a “consumer” at a conference, but when you start to see the conference as “collaboration” and “community” then you really start to be fully a part of the group.</p>  <p>Finally, there is the whole “Twitter Tribe” and “Facebook Folks” aspect of the conference.&#160; That is, there are some people that I’ve met only briefly (or never met in person at all) but follow and lightly interact with online. CodeMash is a chance to really put faces together with people and have the richer personal interaction that builds relationships with other people who share the same “craft” and many of the same interests.</p>  <p>So if I stray into “geek speak” over the next few days oblige me a little bit and I can explain more when I get back and see you face to face.</p>','What is CodeMash?','','publish','open','open','','what-is-codemash','','','2009-01-06 00:31:10','2009-01-06 00:31:10','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/What-is-CodeMash.aspx',0,'post','',1),(51,2,'2009-01-02 03:08:00','2009-01-02 03:08:00','<p>I wanted to write a 2008 post for a couple of reasons: 1) for “historical” reasons to look back on later, and 2) to let new (and old) people who actually read this blog know a little bit more about me.&#160; So without further ado….</p>  <h3>2008 Milestones</h3>  <ul>   <li><strong>Space Shuttle Launch at Kennedy Space Center</strong> – Saw a live launch of something that actually left Earth.&#160; It’s been a life-long dream and was well worth it. </li>    <li><strong>Two new puppies </strong>– Kirby and Bella, our little 2-3lb Yorkie-poos.&#160; Bella is sitting at my feet even while writing this.&#160; Very loyal, but tiny. </li>    <li><strong>Laura’s ankle-fusion surgery</strong> – after years of pain from bone-on-bone rubbing in her feet and ankle, we decided to have the surgery this summer.&#160; Months of no weight-bearing and still in recovery, but should lead to many more options for us this next summer. </li> </ul>  <br />  <h3>Favorite New Gadget - Remote Car Starter</h3>  <ul>   <li>Probably the least “hi-tech” of any new technology, but this winter it has really been awesome.&#160;&#160; A “must-have” gadget, to me, is one you really didn’t know much about, then you got it, used it, and now can’t figure out what you would do without it.&#160; This definitely fits here. </li>    <li><strong>Runner Up - iPod Touch</strong> – also a birthday present, and probably the gadget with the most potential.&#160; I’m going to learn a bit about how to program software for the iPhone and Touch next week, and really like the device (far beyond music and videos). </li>    <li><strong>Runner Up - Craftsman Snowblower</strong> – an early Christmas present saved us from 50+ inches of snow in December, and made it easy enough to help others on our street and help move cars that were stuck in the snow. </li>    <li><strong>Runner Up - Wii / Wii-Fit</strong> – Really an amazing achievement from both a technical and programming standpoint – you really have to see it or try it to understand. </li>    <li><strong>Runner Up - HP Tablet PC</strong> – small (12”) portable machine that’s been with me to work, robotics, quizzing, church and really anywhere I’ve needed something.&#160; Looking at the possibility of getting “netbooks” for the kids this year. </li> </ul>  <br />  <h3>Favorite New Technology - Silverlight 2.0</h3>  <ul>   <li>I have to pick Silverlight because I’ve been programming in it non-stop for the last 7-8 months.&#160; In short, Silverlight is an environment for programming really interactive applications that can be contained in web pages (much like Flash or Java Applets).&#160; The advantages of Silverlight are technical and would require another post, but I really believe that it will make a big impact on how web and mobile applications are written going forward. </li>    <li><strong>Runner Up - ASP.NET MVC</strong> – better way to write web applications. </li>    <li><strong>Runner Up – Twitter/Facebook</strong> – got to meet and interact with several hundred new and long-time friends on an informal basis and keep track of all that is going on with them.&#160; Great way to keep track of people so you can really catch up quickly when you see each other face-to-face. </li>    <li><strong>Runner Up – iPhone apps and web apps</strong> – I really want to be able to program for people that are “not at their computer” and iPhone and Touch applications may be a very important way of doing so. </li> </ul>  <br />  <h3>Best Movie - WALL-E</h3>  <ul>   <li>So I don’t get out much to watch movies – five or less all year (see more on DVD, but not that many more).&#160; I really liked WALL-E for a number of reasons.&#160; A robot “star” (love robot stuff), amazingly limited dialog (movie “says” so much just through “body language”, context and situations.&#160; And the movie actually had some pretty “deep” things to say about relationships, personal responsibility, consumerism, and appropriate use of technology. </li> </ul>  <br />  <h3>Best New Activity - Family Swim Night at the YMCA</h3>  <ul>   <li>We’ve been going swimming as a family on Friday nights and Sunday afternoon since Laura started her rehab after surgery.&#160; This has been great as a family activity and for getting some good activity during the winter months.&#160; The YMCA had a promotion where we could start up again at no charge (we’d been members a while ago), so it was a deal we couldn’t pass up. </li>    <li><strong>Runner Up - Bots on the Rock</strong> -&#160; We wanted to get an informal group going who liked creating, inventing, programming and playing with LEGO robots, so we started a group with some friends to do just that.&#160; We’ve been going for a year now and have even more plans going forward.&#160; Fun and learning all in one. </li> </ul>  <br />  <h3>Most Interesting Book - <em>The Shack</em></h3>  <ul>   <li>Unfortunately I read for pleasure lately even less that I see movies, but I did squeeze in a couple books this year (and have a booklist already started for 2009 to remedy this issue). <em>The Shack</em> was a book that I missed in the “first pass” and heard a lot of people talking about at church, work and on Twitter/Facebook. And when I say people talking is was really a lot more like debating or dialoguing about the book and everyone seemed to have an opinion or idea about it.&#160; So much so that folks wanted to get together and discuss it.&#160; So I picked it up and read it and had a similar response.&#160; In short it is a fictional account of a man who has had some significant loss and tragedy in his life, who through a series of events has an experience, dream, vision, or something where he ends up having a dialog with characters who represent God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit.&#160; Sound strange?&#160; It is.&#160; Worth reading and discussing? It was. </li>    <li><strong>Runner Up - </strong><em><strong>The Appeal</strong> – </em>I do like John Grisham, and my mom and grandma both recommended reading it.&#160; It is another book that evokes an emotional response – mostly anger that this is really probably the way things happen in “real life”. </li>    <li>Sad note on the book front, we lost Michael Crichton this year – one of my favorite authors growing up.&#160; I’ve read his books like: Andromeda Strain, The Great Train Robbery, Congo, Sphere, Jurassic Park, Disclosure, State of Fear and at least 5 more less popular titles.&#160; He had a great imagination and perspective on technology and issues surrounding technology, and great suspense and action.&#160; He will be missed.      <br /></li> </ul>  <br />  <h3>Biggest Bummer - Michigan Economy</h3>  <ul>   <li>The down economy seems to have impacted every part of our lives.&#160; From friends losing their jobs, to houses losing value and not selling, to retirement plans dissolving, travel plans changing, and just a general gloomy feeling.&#160; We’ve all adapted and changed and perhaps grown closer because of it.&#160; But a positive change in 2009 would be very helpful. </li>    <li>Runner Up - Seeming demise of the Grand Rapids / West Michigan User Group – This is related to the economy as well as many programming jobs have gone away, and many companies don’t have discretionary money to donate to such causes.&#160; So individuals stop attending and can’t support the group and companies stop supporting the group.&#160; Even the leadership of the group is impacted.&#160; Hopefully the new year and new jobs will encourage people to get interested and involved again.&#160; I’ve seen these things go in cycles and soon the should be a void that the group can fill again. </li>    <li>Runner Up - Car died – enough said. </li>    <li>Runner Up - Detroit Lions – too much has already been said. </li> </ul>  <br />  <p>I am sure I missed something major or noteworthy in 2008 that failed my mental recall attempt this morning, so I’ll update this post as needed.&#160;

The PowerBook 170 was much better but cost $5,000 each (in 1991 money) and only lasted a year in production as well.</p>  <p>Come forward 16 years and there is the ambitious “One Laptop per Child” vision of Nicholas Negroponte that brings some of the best minds together to figure out how to build a cheap and rugged laptop to enable students world-wide to gain access to a wealth of information and functionality.&#160;

This is a non-trivial purchase so I am considering it very carefully.&#160; The market for Netbooks is coming together quickly, though there is even a <a href=\"http://jkontherun.com/2008/12/23/netbook-enthusiast-web-sites-getting-c-d-using-term-netbook/\">new challenge this week</a> over whether the term “netbook” is trademarked.&#160; But the issue for this post is a recap of what I would really like to see in a Netbook, and why.     <br clear=\"all\" /></p>  <h3>&#160;</h3>  <h3>The first few things would be related to the “Net” part of “Netbook”</h3>  <ul>   <li>The device should be able to operate when not connected to the Internet, but should <strong>achieve full potential and functionality when connected to a network</strong>.&#160; There should be options for achieving this connectivity including network cable, Wi-Fi, and mobile networks (3G, EDGE, WiMAX, etc.).&#160; For the later, the ability to integrate the connectivity within the main case is ideal (don’t want a “dongle” for each type of connectivity). </li>    <li>Bluetooth – not required.&#160; If it is “on the chip” with the other wireless features, then go for it.&#160; But if it adds even $20 to the cost (and/or measurably reduces battery life) then leave it out. </li>    <li>Needs to run OS-independent software from “the cloud”.&#160; I don’t care if the Netbook itself runs XP, OSX, Vista, Ubuntu, Android, etc. as its base OS, as long as there is a platform that <strong>software can be developed on to run across devices</strong>.&#160; This could be Flash/Flex, Silverlight, JavaFX, AIR, etc.&#160; The ability to develop, market, and sell/distribute apps to the different Netbooks is really important. </li>    <li>An <strong>optical drive should not be required</strong>, but could be connected as an external USB/eSATA device.&#160; Installing “full-blown” applications from a CD/DVD should be possible, but limited.&#160; Limiting local storage should be a goal to enable apps running from the “cloud” and saving data back to the network as well. </li>    <li><strong>Basic CPU</strong> – no quad-core x64 3D gaming rig here.&#160; A nice low-power CPU, optimized for wireless applications would be nice.&#160; Atom processors are the rage right now but VIA and AMD have processors that would work too. </li> </ul>  <h3>&#160;</h3>  <h3>The next few things would be related to the “Book” part of “Netbook”</h3>  <ul>   <li>First, it should be <strong>roughly the size of a book</strong> – could be a hardcover, paperback or in between.&#160; This puts it somewhere between an iPhone and a traditional laptop computer.&#160; A target would be 8-10” screen size.&#160; It seems that some are now at the WSVGA screen size (1024x600), better than SVGA (800x600) but full XGA would be nicer (1024x768) (see cost discussion later). </li>    <li>It should provide many of the same functions of a book (reading, reference, easy access to information). </li>    <li>It should be <strong>“dockable”</strong> to use a larger display (keyboard, mouse, etc.) if available at a desk or lab. </li>    <li>Fairly <strong>ruggedized</strong> and should <strong>not weigh very much</strong> (think carry in backpacks) – 2 pounds would be ideal.&#160; This device will share backpack space with other books, be banged around a bit, and will inevitably be dropped or otherwise abused. Netbooks that are engineered well in this area (e.g. rubber, plastics, where appropriate, SSD drives instead of spinning media, etc.) will have a definite upper-hand. </li> </ul>  <h3>&#160;</h3>  <h3>Finally things that really have nothing to do with “Net” or “Book” but are things I think of being part of this device.</h3>  <ul>   <li><strong>Webcam and microphone input</strong> – I really think that multi-media and multi-modal input for so many things is really important that I hesitate to leave this for just those that add external devices. </li>    <li>Basic speakers – nothing special.&#160; Headphone jack. </li>    <li>Touch/Tablet screen – torn on this one.&#160; There is a lot going on with multi-touch on the iPhone and Windows 7, but nothing really “proven” yet.&#160; I think the expense that this would add would not be worth the money </li>    <li><strong>Battery life</strong> – probably the biggest hurdle Netbooks face.&#160; Ideally it would last a full work/school day, <strong>say 6 hours of use.</strong>&#160; Ideally the device could “sleep/hibernate” easily and have it easy to swap in a fully charged battery.&#160; Kind of like batteries for cordless drills and other tools – yes the Netbook is a tool. </li>    <li>Now that we are talking money.&#160; The device should be <strong>$400</strong> +/-$100.&#160; Under $300 would probably be made so cheaply that it would violate the “ruggedness” need or some of the features.&#160; More than $500 and it is getting too expensive.&#160; I know this is a tight margin for prices. </li> </ul>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>I’ll update this post if/when I decide to commit on which ones to buy.&#160; I’d appreciate any feedback or ideas that others have in this area as well.</p>  <p><strong><em>Update 1:</em></strong> Added some details, fixed some weird formatting</p>','What would make a good/great Netbook?','','publish','open','open','','what-would-make-a-goodgreat-netbook','','','2008-12-24 05:26:15','2008-12-24 05:26:15','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/What-would-make-a-goodgreat-Netbook.aspx',0,'post','',2),(53,2,'2008-12-04 23:35:10','2008-12-04 23:35:10','<p>You may or may not know about the <a href=\"http://www.woot.com\">www.woot.com</a> site where they sell one item per day until it is gone at really good prices.&#160; That’s cool, and there are great deals, but they also have a sense of humor which is lacking in most retail situations.&#160; The latest example of this is a status note I got yesterday on a product that was a few weeks late in shipping.&#160; I don’t know if any of it is true, but it is kind of funny, and the order did ship a few hours later …</p>  <table style=\"background-color: #ffffcc\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\" width=\"400\" border=\"0\"><tbody>     <tr>       <td valign=\"top\" width=\"400\">         <p>Dear Bruce,            <br />            <br />Our records indicate you purchased the Star Wars Vault 30 years of Treasures item from us on Nov. 21.

But the ImplicitStyleManager (and related Theme classes) will now allow designers to encapsulate their design work into an assembly and xaml resource dictionary, and easily apply the theme to an entire page (or part of a page).</p>  <p>On the surface this is “duh” you could do that before – but not so.&#160; You had to “touch” every control and add a Style and/or Template to it and have that StaticResource appear in a generic.xaml or App.xaml somewhere in your app.&#160; Now you should be able to “style-up” and entire Page/App in a few declarative steps.</p>  <p>This means that there could be a market for professional looking themes for Silverlight apps that developers could apply for a really polished look in their applications.&#160;

It is a brand new class inheriting from ClassMap&lt;T&gt; and we pass in the FlashcardEntity as the generic type.&#160; Then, in the constructor, we simply define which table in the database contains the Flashcard data, and which element is the primary key.&#160; Since we named the columns in the database the same as the property names we don’t need to use the overload with the column names.&#160; Because of that all we need to do is to add all the Mappings with a simple lambda expression.&#160; The References call is cool.&#160; It “says” that “there is a column called QuizQuestionTypeID that references a single QuizQuestionType object, please go get it for me.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 4) Initialize the Connection and Mapping.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do we initialize the connection and mappings we’ve defined?&#160;

This is because these generic methods can be used for any object that is created and mapped in this way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking back at this there is really only 30 lines of code for the objects (interface, object, and mapping) and the rest of this code is reusable for all objects in the solution.&#160;

These will be details, link and some sample code.&#160; I am in the process of making sure my code samples are functional under the release version of Silverlight 2.0 RTW - this should be done by Monday (getting the paying/work projects moved over first, and it is going really well).</p>  <p>Since the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference is getting underway in about 10 days, and Silverlight released well in advance of that, I figured it would be a good time to get some requests in for the next version(s) of Silverlight.&#160; To put this in context for those not in attendance, most of the work I\'ve been doing in Silverlight is in the health care and medical fields, with a side project of some Bible quiz games, a jukebox and flashcards.</p>  <p>#1) <strong>Microphone and WebCam Support:</strong> Doctors don\'t like to type, and while this is a generalization, dictation services are still doing very well in the market.&#160; To support &quot;digital dictation&quot; I really need an ability to record and transfer digital audio files from Silverlight down to the server.&#160; Add in web cam support as well and the kids can upload an avatar picture to personalize their account a bit as well.</p>  <p>#2) <strong>Cross-device as well as cross-browser:</strong> several of the doctors and company owners that we deal with regularly are proud iPhone owners.&#160; Kids have their iPods, Zunes, and XBOXes.&#160; Doctors are moving to pen-based tablet-based devices (sometimes PCs, sometimes not) to carry from room to room.&#160; Less and less people are sitting down at a computer to do their work or entertainment.&#160; We need to be able to target portable devices and game consoles with Silverlight applications.</p>  <p>#3)<strong> Full keyboard support for full-screen applications:</strong> Come on! Do you really have to disable all but a handful of &quot;popular gaming keys&quot; when the application goes to full-screen mode.&#160; Isn\'t there another way to keep people &quot;safe&quot; from deceptive Silverlight apps?&#160; This takes away the ability for data-entry and full-screen apps for educational purposes.</p>  <p>#4) <strong>Improve the tools and error messages:</strong> This is evolutionary, but to develop now you really need both Blend and Visual Studio 2008 (neither has critical features of the other (e.g. Intellisense, template support)).&#160; And some of the error messages are so cryptic, and can mean so many different things, that they mine as well just be &quot;Syntax Error&quot;&#160; (actually that is even more useful in some cases).&#160; I am sure these are things that will come with time, but they do point to an immature system.</p>  <p>#5) <strong>More native controls:</strong> But I hear that there may be announcements to this effect even in the next few weeks.&#160; The native (i.e. available in the plug-in or Microsoft-supplied .dll) controls for Silverlight have gone from literally nothing (i.e. make your own textbox) up to a respectable starter set of common controls (better than ASP.NET at launch).&#160; But I always want more.&#160; Some of my top requests (e.g. autocomplete, tree, expander, etc.) have already been announced as controls to be released&#160; coming weeks.&#160; These will allow for some really great user experiences without a lot of expensive and lengthy time being spent on low-level user-interface work.</p>  <p><strong><em>[Updated - forgot one]</em></strong> #6) <strong>Offline and/or out-of-browser execution:</strong> This goes away from the traditional use of a &quot;browser plug-in&quot;, but it would be great if the Silverlight code could be used while offline (yes there are places without wireless connectivity).&#160; Also, the ability to (optionally) &quot;install&quot; the application so it can run in its own window with a shortcut, icon, etc. would be really useful- ala Chrome application settings and Adobe AIR.&#160; I guess you could get this functionality today by using Chrome to view the Silverlight page and saving it as an application with settings, but it would be best if Silverlight could do this natively without a particular browser.</p>  <p>More coming soon, and I\'ll post the PowerPoint stack as well - <a href=\"http://www.officelabs.com/projects/pptPlex/Pages/default.aspx\">here is a link to the pptPlex site with downloads</a> for those who were interested in trying out that cool PowerPoint plug-in.</p>','Silverlight IRL - Requests','','publish','open','open','','silverlight-irl-requests','','','2008-10-15 23:00:19','2008-10-15 23:00:19','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Silverlight-IRL-Requests.aspx',0,'post','',2),(59,2,'2008-10-09 07:01:00','2008-10-09 07:01:00','<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\" width=\"384\" height=\"304\">\r\n	<param name=\"width\" value=\"384\" />\r\n	<param name=\"height\" value=\"304\" />\r\n	<param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"firstname=Bruce&amp;lastname=Abernethy&amp;urlfin=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tsgnet.com%2Fpres.php?id=46832%26altf=Lfjui%26altl=Hjmmjpo%26lap=2\" />\r\n	<param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\" />\r\n	<param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" />\r\n	<param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.paltalk.com/marketing/media/vanksen/main.swf\" />\r\n	<embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"384\" height=\"304\" flashvars=\"firstname=Bruce&amp;lastname=Abernethy&amp;urlfin=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tsgnet.com%2Fpres.php?id=46832%26altf=Lfjui%26altl=Hjmmjpo%26lap=2\" bgcolor=\"#000000\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" src=\"http://www.paltalk.com/marketing/media/vanksen/main.swf\"></embed>\r\n</object>\r\n','Someone had to do it!','','publish','open','open','','someone-had-to-do-it','','','2008-10-09 07:01:00','2008-10-09 07:01:00','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Someone-had-to-do-it!.aspx',0,'post','',0),(60,2,'2008-09-16 02:17:44','2008-09-16 02:17:44','<p>After a really busy summer I am making an effort to get back into a routine which includes posting about some interesting things going on personally, professionally, and otherwise.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>I thought a “soft-launch” back into it would be sharing one of my pet-peeves of the day.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/Reason458PeopleDontLikeComputers_90C1/search_results_oops_2.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px;

So we are undertaking a process to evaluate Silverlight and prove out some of the “unknowns” of Silverlight.</p>  <p>Other options are out there for the User Interface for this application: </p>  <p>(1) A “fat” installed app (WPF or WinForm) – the current app is a fat Windows 3.11/95-looking application with decent performance (especially when it was designed on PC’s with 1/10 the power of today’s applications).&#160; But this app will be widely deployed (50+ sites) and tech support is limited and costly to overhead.&#160; Web applications, or at least web-deployed applications, are preferred.</p>  <p>(2) An Ajax-enabled Web Site.&#160; There is a lot of “magic” you can do with a little Ajax and some custom Javascript coding.&#160; But, having done several of these sites, you end up feeling that you are making a web page do something “unnatural” (i.e. something it wasn’t designed to do).&#160; And supporting and debugging these applications can be complicated.&#160; Plus there is an inherent performance issue with even the best designed web application.&#160; This is especially true when coming from a very performant Windows application to a new browser-based application.</p>  <p>(3) Flash/Flex. In addition to this Silverlight POC, at CQL we are working on a Flash and a Flex-based application from two other companies.&#160; We’re updating a Flash-based application that gets a lot of XML-based data from simple web services, and we’re writing the services to support a modern site-wide Flex-based application.&#160; There are other RIA options out there, and the two different design firms have much more experience with the Adobe products than Silverlight.&#160; To their credit they have heard of and have used the basic Silverlight tools already, but never anything “production.”&#160; So we need to prove to our clients and our design partners that this is a good idea.</p>  <p>So, what needs to be proven and how are we going to go about proving it out.</p>  <h2>Here is the start of the list – this will build over the next few weeks.</h2>  <p>1) Automated testing – how to test the front-end Silverlight controls using automated testing tools</p>  <p>2) Web Service calls / Databinding – using secure web service calls for data routines.&#160; Pull-type calls for common actions/methods.&#160; Also Publish/Subscribe type services that could push important data to subscribed controls.&#160; How to handle disconnected concurrency issues?</p>  <p>3) Security / Roles – encrypted traffic.&#160; Working in the same security context as the containing web application (i.e. login, roles, etc.)</p>  <p>4) Dynamic Control Loading – app needs to perform very well and should only load the components that are needed at any one time.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p>5) Keyboard/Keystroke/Hot-Keys – many of the current functions of the system have assigned key shortcuts than enable staff members to quickly access common features.&#160; Can this be reproduced in Silverlight?</p>  <p>6) Stress/Load Testing – How does the load of an application that is mainly web service based differ from that of a get/post HTML web application?&#160; Many small messages vs. less frequent bigger messages.</p>  <p>7) Real-world ability to work with designers – We’ve all seen the PowerPoint slides showing how easy it is to work with XAML between developers and designers.&#160; Is it true?&#160; Does it work in real life?</p>  <p>8) Uploading a file – can it be done in Silverlight or will we need some Ajax/Web Page interaction?</p>  <p>9) Drag-and-Drop – part of the app is a scheduling calendar – can appointments be rescheduled via drag-and-drop?</p>  <p>10) Controls – are there enough now for what we need in beta 2?&#160; Are any third-party controls worth using/buying?&#160; Can we do common data-entry validation (e.g. masked-edit textbox)?</p>','Silverlight Proof-of-Concept &ndash; Top 10 Questions to Be Answered','','publish','open','open','','silverlight-proof-of-concept-top-10-questions-to-be-answered','','','2008-07-07 07:27:04','2008-07-07 07:27:04','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Silverlight-Proof-of-Concept-ndash3b-Top-10-Questions-to-Be-Answered.aspx',0,'post','',6),(62,2,'2008-06-11 00:47:51','2008-06-11 00:47:51','<p></p>  <p>If you ask most of the world about Steve Job’s keynote this week, they will basically tell you that it was the iPhone 3G announcement (new cheaper, faster, stronger, iPhone for the world) – which is true, but it was more than that.&#160; This was at the WWDC (world-wide developers conference) for Apple Computer.&#160; </p>  <h3>iPhone as a Primary Platform</h3>  <p>There were 5200 (sold out) developers at the WWDC for 147 different sessions (85 on Mac, 62 on iPhone). <u>62 on iPhone</u> – 42% of the developer sessions were on the iPhone and new iPhone SDK 2.0.&#160; You see, Apple doesn’t sell that many Macs, as their competitors will tell you.&#160; Macs are only 5-10% of the total number of personal computers out there.&#160; When Apple came out with the iPod and iTunes, they found a market they could dominate.&#160; One of the other slides in this part of the keynote said there were “Three parts to Apple now Mac, Music, and iPhone”.&#160; Apple makes as much, or more, on their iPods and Music as they do their Macintosh computers.&#160; </p>  <p>Now they are looking to dominate the cell phone market as well – specifically the Internet-enabled “smart-phone” market.&#160; And much of the rest of the keynote showed how seriously they are taking this market.&#160; There has been talk of this trend away from personal computers and toward “intra-personal communicators”.&#160; People don’t want to be “tethered” to a desktop PC, but mobile with their laptops and cell phones.</p>  <p><u>Mobile devices are a first-class development platform for 2008+</u></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <h3>Partnership and Perception</h3>  <p>So what does Apple need to dominate the phone business that they don’t already have? (1) the Enterprise user (i.e. the Blackberry crowd), (2) the College / GenX crowd, and (3) the Techy crowd (i.e. the ones who timed every download on the “old” EDGE network), (4) Loyal Mac/iPhone fans, (5) Education users (very loyal to Apple) and (6) everyone else.</p>  <p>When announcing all their new features, Apple did some important things.&#160; For the Enterprise announcements they teamed up with top Fortune 500 companies to add credibility.&#160; They dropped key technology names like Exchange and Cisco to gain points with the corporate IT crowd. SEGA was first off with a motion-sensitive Super Monkey Ball application to appeal to fun/gamers with an app done in “2 weeks” that beats all/most N-Gage games 3 or more years into development.&#160; Then for “everyone else” there is eBay, TypePad, AP, MLB.com, etc.&#160; For the Techys/Mac folks there are demos of “Cow Music” and games from Pangea Software.&#160; For Education there are Medical content/training demonstrations.</p>  <p>In short it shows that Apple understands the market and their customers and has something to say to all of them.</p>  <p>Microsoft is doing a similar thing with Silverlight and the Olympics, MLB, NetFlix, and others.</p>  <p><u>It doesn’t matter how cool your technology is, if key players are not developing for it, then users won’t have any reason to move to it.</u></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <h3>Leveraging the “2.0” Trend</h3>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p>Everything “cool” right now is “2.0” – whether it is Web 2.0, Learning 2.0, etc.&#160; Now there is the iPhone SDK 2.0.&#160; Most developers who wanted apps on the iPhone had to create Safari/Web based apps that fit well on the iPhone browser (and this will continue). But now what is touted as an “entirely new platform” enables full APIs (down to 3D graphics, and “presence”) for developing applications.</p>  <p><u>“2.0” isn’t coming, it is here – BTW, stop calling everything “2.0”</u></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <h3>Internationalization</h3>  <p>It has been largely possible to develop good web sites, and have them be very successful, using only American English.&#160; Some/few sites have worked to become multi-lingual in other primary languages. Apple made it clear that the iPhone will have support world-wide with versions and cell phone carriers in 70 different countries.&#160; </p>  <p><u>Developers need to think about multi-language support from the very beginning of applications.</u></p>','Lessons from Keynote #2 &ndash; Steve Jobs','','publish','open','open','','lessons-from-keynote-2-steve-jobs','','','2008-06-11 00:47:51','2008-06-11 00:47:51','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Lessons-from-Keynote-2-ndash3b-Steve-Jobs.aspx',0,'post','',1),(63,2,'2008-06-10 06:04:00','2008-06-10 06:04:00','<p>There have been two interesting keynote speeches in recent memory: Bill Gates at TechEd, and Steve Jobs at WWDC.&#160; They both reflected on the current state of technology, made predictions, and made announcements.&#160; So what of lasting value came out of what they had to say, and how might this impact choices being made for the future?&#160; I’ll give you my $.02 worth on both of them, and see what you think as well (and I’ll try to fix the Blog comments to get some feedback too).</p>  <p>Let’s start with Bill Gates (<a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2008/06-03teched.mspx\">transcript</a>).&#160; Perhaps the most notable thing coming out of Bill’s keynote is that it will be his last as chairman of Microsoft.&#160; I’m sure he’ll be talking in the future, but not in the same capacity.&#160; What effect might this have on the future of Microsoft?&#160; How much impact has he had in the last few years as chairman, and in what areas of the company?</p>  <h3>Continued Increases in Performance</h3>  <p>The new trend for increased performance is no longer increases in chip speed (i.e. number of instructions per second).&#160; Now the increases will largely come from having many different cores and processors doing work together in a single machine or on a single chip.&#160; Also, there are systems working together across different machines, even out across the Internet.&#160; Today’s programs aren’t written to take advantage of this Parallel processing and Cloud computing.&#160; New techniques, tools and frameworks will need to be built in order to take advantage of these new resources, or else fall behind.&#160; Sun’s John Gage quote, and Sun’s motto, “The Network is the Computer” is turning into “The Network is the CPU”.&#160; Programmers who don’t learn how to segment and separate their code for distributed processing will soon find themselves at the same disadvantage as those that couldn’t move from procedural programming to event-based and object-oriented techniques.</p>  <h3>Changes in Interaction</h3>  <p>A big theme in this talk was the future of human-computer interaction.&#160; Now our input devices are basically keyboard and mouse and to a certain extent pen.&#160; The future is all about “natural interfaces” like touch (and multi-touch), voice, and vision. Star Trek, especially The Next Generation, seemed to me to have a nice balance in their technology user interfaces.&#160; There was voice interaction, tactile/touch <a href=\"http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Lcars\">LCARS</a> screens, and pen-based <a href=\"http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/PADD\">PADDs</a>.&#160; The Microsoft Surface touch technology, now being demoed for Microsoft Windows 7, could easily implement LCARS.&#160; iPhones have done PADDs even one better by including the communicator.&#160; Really the only illusive technology is the voice-recognition, which is still very hit-or-miss with today’s technology.&#160; The vision systems have a lot to offer.&#160; The Wii implements vision and 3D motion in their controller to great success.&#160; The main lesson here is that developers who do not spend some time looking beyond simple point-and-click and keyboard input may also find themselves falling behind.</p>  <h3>Robotics</h3>  <p>The last thing that struck me was a seemingly larger commitment to robotics than I have seen from Microsoft before. In a sense robotics is extending the range and type of outputs in much the way the “natural interfaces” were extending the inputs.&#160; They made the interesting comparison between the robotics development environments today and the computer programming environments 30 years ago.&#160; Developing for robots means developing for a mobile system.&#160; It means being able to process a wide variety of sensors and inputs and make decisions quickly.&#160; It also means programming routines that are constantly running (e.g. keeping the robot balanced, monitoring the environment, etc.) and that run independent from one another.&#160; On interesting component in the Microsoft Robotics Studio is the very sophisticated simulation environment.&#160; What it means is that people can create programs for very expensive or dangerous robots and run a variety of tests and actions without ever needing to test on the actual hardware.&#160; In fact Microsoft has started a Robochamp competition to see how well people can do at programming robots in large-scale scenarios (e.g. DARPA urban challenge, Mars rover, etc.) without needing the hardware (or getting to Mars).&#160; In a sense this is disappointing because you don’t get to do the engineering and inventing of the robot (which LEGO Robotics folks will tell you is more than half the battle).&#160; But in another sense it means the people with a simple download can get a flavor of what this type of programming is like without a huge investment.</p>  <p>Creating programs that talk to a wide variety of peripherals and take input from many sensors is an important trend here.&#160; And learning to program and test in a simulated or virtual environment is also a good thing to learn.&#160; All-in-all I think this was a very good breakdown of some of the challenges facing developers today.</p>  <p>Next we’ll look at Steve Job’s perspective …..</p>','Lessons from Keynote #1: Bill Gates','','publish','open','open','','lessons-from-keynote-1-bill-gates','','','2008-06-10 06:04:00','2008-06-10 06:04:00','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Lessons-from-Keynote-1-Bill-Gates.aspx',0,'post','',1),(64,2,'2008-06-06 07:34:57','2008-06-06 07:34:57','<p>Continuing the <a href=\"http://www.michaeleatonconsulting.com/blog/archive/2008/06/04/how-did-you-get-started-in-software-development.aspx\">How</a> I <a href=\"http://www.rosscode.com/blog/index.php?title=how_i_got_started_in_software_developmen&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1\">Got</a> <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22how+I+got+started+in+software+development%22&amp;btnG=Search\">Started</a> Meme… cool idea, get to know the TwitterTribe better (and others)</p>  <h3>How old were you when you started programming?</h3>  <p>Wrote first program at 11 - BASIC 1.0 on Commodore PET </p>  <h3>How did you get started in programming?</h3>  <p>In grade school I was most likely ADD, so when I got done with my school work early I was a bit &quot;high-maintenance&quot;.&#160; The teacher\'s solution was to send me to the library and let me be someone else\'s problem.&#160; Fortunately the librarian was great and always had stuff to do, books, filmstrips, etc.&#160; Then one day the Commodore PET arrived and I lost 2-3 hours a day for the rest of 6th grade.&#160; The sample apps were fun to play, but I wanted to see how they worked.&#160; Some apps were &quot;protected&quot; but many others you could see the BASIC code.&#160; A few books and a text-editor later, we were on our way.&#160; Wrote several semi-complex apps, but they were pretty juvenile. </p>  <h3>What was your first language?</h3>  <p>BASIC 1.0 </p>  <h3>What was the first real program you wrote?</h3>  <p>First of any length was a &quot;Lord of the Rings Adventure&quot; game, modeled loosely on some of the Scott Adams Adventures that were poplular at the time (e.g. Adventureland, Pirate Adventure, etc.).&#160; It was text-only (i.e. a &quot;console app&quot; for younglings) even had a basic parser (bunch of nested if/thens) - AppleSoft Basic.&#160; Even made up some disks of it to sell as &quot;shareware&quot;.&#160; Never sold any - gave a couple away. </p>  <p>First program I ever got anything for was a simulation of a beam of light bouncing off a parabolic mirror for the Cranbrook Institute of Science.&#160; They had a huge (4-5 foot diameter) parabolic mirror in one of the exhibits and wanted to simulate how the beams of light went into the mirror and back out.&#160; The program used Apple ][ &quot;hi-res&quot; graphics and a game paddle (PEEK/POKE) so you could move the beams of light around and watch how they moved across the screen, off the mirror, and all went through the focal point.&#160; Hardest part was drawing the parabola.&#160; All I got for it was free admission and access to some of the &quot;backroom&quot; areas of the museum - it was worth it.&#160; Funny thing was when I went back years later the mirror was gone but the Apple ][ was still there (as an exhibit - sigh). </p>  <h3>What languages have you used since you started programming?</h3>  <p>I\'ll define &quot;used&quot; as writing 2 or more programs, over 1000 lines of code.    <br />BASIC (many variants), 6502/68000 Assembly, Pascal (several), PAL, Fortran 77, Modula-2, C, Objective C, RPL, AppleScript, HyperTalk, Mathematica, Javascript, LOGO, Iptscrae, Perl, SQL, Java, ActionScript, VBScript, VB.NET, C#, NXT-G </p>  <p>In the &quot;hello world, up and coming&quot; list are: F#, VPL, PHP </p>  <h3>What was your first professional programming gig?</h3>  <p>The first full-time (summer) job where I got a paycheck was at the Masonry Institute of Michigan.&#160; They needed a Novell 2.11 server installed, Baseband wiring for a network, and mostly a shared database server application.&#160; This was a Paradox database, which meant I spent a few months learning and programming some pretty complex apps in &quot;PAL&quot;.&#160; There are still some nice things you could do with PAL that are much more complex to do today. </p>  <p>The next summer I got paid as a research assistant programming quantum-mechanical wave functions in Fortran 77 on a Cray YMP Supercomputer.&#160; The Cray was in California and we connected first via 300 baud modems, and later over this new &quot;Internet&quot; thing. </p>  <p>First full-time professional web programming job was using SuiteSpot with LiveWire Pro from Netscape Communications Corp to code in server-side Javascript.&#160;

But a little background first.&#160; Every two years (i.e. the &quot;even&quot; years) since 1990 there has been a conference called the <a href=\"http://www.calvin.edu/academic/engl/festival/\">Festival of Faith and Writing</a>, this is the fourth time I\'ve been able to attend.&#160; </p>  <p>Over the years they have attracted great writers, presenters, artists, publishers, editors, etc. (e.g. Updike, L\'Engle, Weisel, Dillard, Rushdie) and this year is no different.&#160; Tonight\'s keynote was Pulitzer Prize winning author Michael Chabon (<em>The Yiddish Policemen\'s Union</em>, <em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay</em>, <em>McSweeney\'s Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories</em>).&#160; It was really an inspiring message, and was not at all what I expected.&#160; Tomorrow night\'s speaker is Yann Martel (<em>Life of Pi</em>) and Saturday night is Katherine Paterson (<em>Bridge to Terabithia</em>, <em>Jacob I Have Loved</em>).&#160; This is after a full day of shorter topical sessions that are also very good.</p>  <p>But why am I here?&#160; I don\'t write like I used to.&#160; I previously co-wrote a few computer textbooks and labs for teachers and students in the early 90s and monthly educational technology articles for 9 years, through 2006.&#160; But really nothing now.&#160; Should I continue using two vacation days and a lot of time to attend this conference.&#160; After today, I\'d have to say an enthusiastic &quot;yes&quot;.</p>  <p>The reasons I am eager to attend are varied but mainly include getting out of my &quot;comfort zone&quot; for a short time and experiencing a culture and community in a depth that can rarely be seen in any other forum.&#160; While attending a &quot;reading&quot; (Shauna Niequest reading <em>Cold Tangerines</em>) this morning I realized that I was perhaps only one of 6-7 men in a room full of women of all ages.&#160; I decided that this may be the location of all the women who were notably absent at all the technology conferences I attend.&#160; This is not to say anything bad about men or women - in fact let me make an open invitation to any women who would like to attend our upcoming Day of .NET 2008 on May 10.&#160; Even if it is &quot;sold out&quot; (still free) I\'ll find a way for you to get in if you want to check it out.&#160; To hear her read one of her very funny and insightful essays (that somehow included childbirth and road rage) was something special and kicked of the day rather well.</p>  <p>But the variety of the day was just getting started.&#160; Next Mary Gordon (<em>Final Payments</em>, <em>Men and Angels</em>) discussed &quot;Is Fiction Moral?&quot; which lead to a thread the rest of the day about whether art/writing/etc. is fundamentally &quot;good&quot;.&#160; She added a long experience in writing since the 70s with a feminist and troubled Catholic background, to bring together yet another background and culture I don\'t interact with much.&#160; Next Gary Schmidt shared experiences of dealing with issues of race, economic inequality, broken trust, failed leaders. How a child goes from a world of &quot;run spot run&quot; to one of beginning to understand issues of vocation, economics, politics, aesthetics and relationships - none of which have easy black-and-white answers.</p>  <p>One more main session left, then the keynote at 7:30 tonight.&#160; My mind is already buzzing in parts of my brain that get sadly little use otherwise.&#160; But next is a presentation by Jon J Muth who is an artist/illustrator of children\'s books like <em>Stone Soup</em>, <em>The Three Questions</em>, <em>Zen Shorts</em> (NYT Best Seller, Caldecott Honor) and <em>Zen Ties</em> - not to mention drawing graphic novels like Niel Gaiman\'s <em>The Sandman: The Wake</em> and J.M. DeMatteis\' <em>Moonshadow</em>. Muth is a very talented artist with traditional graphite ink-brush.&#160; Half of his presentation was in demonstrating his craft both drawing an intentional object (an elephant in this case) and in letting the drawing come from the strokes themselves.&#160; A practicing Zen Buddhist and artist, he explained how his beliefs, craft, and the experience of the birth of recent twins, has shaped his current work.</p>  <p>I\'m now on experience and information overload, so I head home to have dinner and a short nap before the keynote (which I can do because I live less than a mile from the keynote location).&#160; Finishing the day with a well prepared and executed essay and talk by Michael Chabon capped off the day nicely.&#160; He recounted his personal experiences as a Jew in search of an identity, as well as being a child with an amazingly active imagination and unnatural taste for genre fiction.&#160; He led us through a winding path through a book he found almost by accident &quot;Say it in Yiddish&quot; which lead to an amazing amount of introspection, creativity, conflict, and ultimately his novel <em>The Yiddish Policemen\'s Union</em>. It was an amazingly humorous, but also touching and personal account of his experiences which have led to his numerous writings.</p>  <p>I have no idea how processing all of this will impact my &quot;real job&quot; or &quot;real life&quot; but to hear essays about childbirth, discussions of morality and truth, feminism, race, politics, inequality, art, Zen, and the lost Yiddish language and culture have all given me unique perspectives that I would otherwise have not had.&#160; Two more days of this, and some reflection, and we\'ll see how this can be applied in my current endeavors.</p>','Day 1 - Festival of Faith and Writing 08','','publish','open','open','','day-1-festival-of-faith-and-writing-08','','','2008-04-17 14:05:59','2008-04-17 14:05:59','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Day-1-Festival-of-Faith-and-Writing-08.aspx',0,'post','',1),(68,2,'2008-03-23 23:54:01','2008-03-23 23:54:01','<p>I don\'t have time to post much this morning, but I wanted to get this out.</p>  <p>This Saturday (March 22, 2008) we attended the West Michigan FIRST Robotics Regional Competition over the weekend.&#160;

There have been screen capture utilities out there since ... well ... since there have been screens, so why is this one different?&nbsp; There are several reasons.</p> <p>First, as with other really useful tools, Window Clippings integrates seamlessly into your system and just seems to become part of the operating system.&nbsp; I hit \"PrtScrn\" and get Window Clippings.</p> <p>Second, it does the most common things I need with a simple click of the mouse.&nbsp; Most often when doing a screen capture you are selecting an entire window - Window Clippings knows this and lets you select a window directly.&nbsp; Also, it is \"Vista Friendly\" - what I mean by this is that Vista introduced all kinds of transparency and \"Aero\" features which can lead to other windows (or your desktop) bleeding through transparent areas on windows that end up in your screen capture.&nbsp; Window clippings isolates the window clears whatever is behind the window from the screen capture.&nbsp; Nice clean window capture.&nbsp; After selecting a single window, the most common thing I need is to capture a section of a window (or the entire screen).&nbsp; Window Clippings lets you crop or expand the capture area before you capture the image so you only get what you want.</p> <p>Third, Window Clippings gives you options of what to do with the captured image.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/CoolToolsWindowClippings_77EC/image_2.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px;

This lets you set up things like opening menus initiating pop-up windows or other \"strange behavior\" on the computer that you couldn\'t capture with a keypress (i.e. the keypress would either not get through or would take focus away from what you were trying to capture).</p> <p>There is a free version that implements many of the functions and may be enough for some people\'s needs.&nbsp; I dropped the whopping $10 for the full version (adds cropping and time-delay, and more).&nbsp; I can easily recommend this tool to others.</p>','Cool Tools: Window Clippings','','publish','open','open','','cool-tools-window-clippings','','','2008-03-18 00:31:44','2008-03-18 00:31:44','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Cool-Tools-Window-Clippings.aspx',0,'post','',1),(70,2,'2008-03-14 03:51:48','2008-03-14 03:51:48','<p>I know Spring Breaks are coming up (or in progress) and people are heading for Florida.&nbsp;

This is for, in my opinion, three reasons.&nbsp; First, it is out of the way a bit - you need to drive a little ways to get there, and it is away from any major city.&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, there are no hotels, motels, restaurants, bars, etc. on the islands - bring a lunch/drinks with you (or settle for the \"snack bar\" type food there).&nbsp; Finally, you have to pay to get in - only $5 per car to Honeymoon Island, add $9/adult and $5.50/child to take the ferry to Caladesi Island (yes you can only get there by boat, but it is worth it (see below).&nbsp; My point is, you need to make an effort (in driving and money) to get there which many/most people will not do.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/FloridaGem2HoneymoonIslandCaladesiIsland_9B0C/image_4.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px;

Let\'s start with the obvious - it\'s the <a href=\"http://travelwithkids.about.com/od/beachvacations/ss/top_beaches_3.htm\">#2 rated beach in the country</a> (and stands up to that rating).&nbsp; I\'ve been to Coco Beach, Daytona Beach, Hilton Head Island, Clearwater Beach, Grand Haven, Sleeping Bear Dunes, and a few others and I can say that Caladesi Island is the nicest beach I have ever been to, by a significant margin.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/FloridaGem2HoneymoonIslandCaladesiIsland_9B0C/image_6.png\"><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/FloridaGem2HoneymoonIslandCaladesiIsland_9B0C/image_10.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px;

There they had a huge deck with a bunch of spotting scopes where we could see herons, egrets, owls, hawks, tortoise and a bunch of other wildlife (even a Nine Branded Armadillo).</p> <p>The tide was heading out as we got there, and there were more shells (empty and full) than we saw in all our other \"shell hunts\" combined.&nbsp; We found many sand dollars and great samples of all kinds of other shells.</p> <p><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; border-right-width: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" align=\"left\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/FloridaGem2HoneymoonIslandCaladesiIsland_9B0C/image_thumb_2.png\" width=\"244\" height=\"184\">One of the ladies that worked there had found a stranded (living) starfish which we put in a pail and watched for a time.&nbsp;

The screen will zoom in 2x centered on your current mouse location.&nbsp; It is a nice animated zoom that clearly shows what is being magnified.&nbsp; If you want to increase (or decrease) the level of zoom you can use the mouse-wheel or up/down arrow keys.&nbsp; Hitting the ESC key or right-mouse button returns you to normal operation.&nbsp; This enables you to quickly zoom up on some text or controls that may be too small to see (or see well) on the screen.&nbsp; This is allI use ZoomIt for 95% of the time.</p> <p>But for completeness there are two other functions that exist.&nbsp; The next is \"Draw\" mode.&nbsp; This is kind of a \"John Madden\" draw-over markup of the current screen.&nbsp; If you want to highlight, circle, point to, or even type on the screen (in 5 fabulous colors) you can with this function.&nbsp; It will remind you of working with a very limited paint program, but can be very effective at drawing attention where you want peoples attention (bad example below). </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/CoolToolsZoomItv1.8_B34A/image_10.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px;

It is a no-nonsense block of red text on a white background that will count down the seconds for the amount of time that you set.&nbsp; It defaults to 10 minutes and you can use the mouse-wheel or up/down arrows to adjust up or down the number of minutes.&nbsp; This is useful if you want to start a presentation on time (i.e. a count-down timer to start), or take a 10/15 minute break in the middle of a presentation, or give your audience a specific amount of time to complete a particular task.&nbsp; Again, a very simple no-nonsense approach, but well implemented if this is something you need.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Miscellaneous/ZoomIt.mspx\">ZoomIt v1.8</a></p>','Cool Tools - ZoomIt v1.8','','publish','open','open','','cool-tools-zoomit-v1-8','','','2008-03-11 04:45:07','2008-03-11 04:45:07','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Cool-Tools-ZoomIt-v18.aspx',0,'post','',0),(72,2,'2008-03-03 23:27:34','2008-03-03 23:27:34','<p>Looks like at least one announcement got out before the MIX\'08 conference even started - and it is a big one.</p>  <p>I am eager to see how this plays out, but it looks like now software developed in Silverlight <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=206901441#community\">will be able to run</a> on Nokia Series 40 and S60 phones (which is <a href=\"http://www.s60.com/life/s60phones/browseDevices.do\">quite a few phones</a> by the way).</p>  <p>I\'m not sure what (if any) subset of the features will be available on phones, and what type of Internet connectivity you can get, but the ability to now easily develop cellphone applications (on non-Microsoft OSes) is really cool.</p>  <p>So how do I get started?</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=206901441#community\">Microsoft, Nokia Put Silverlight On Mobile Devices -- Cell Phone -- InformationWeek</a></p>','Microsoft, Nokia Put Silverlight On Mobile Devices','','publish','open','open','','microsoft-nokia-put-silverlight-on-mobile-devices','','','2008-03-03 23:27:34','2008-03-03 23:27:34','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Microsoft2c-Nokia-Put-Silverlight-On-Mobile-Devices.aspx',0,'post','',0),(73,2,'2008-03-02 23:47:34','2008-03-02 23:47:34','<p><img style=\"border-right: 0px;

You joined up and started posting very short (140 characters) messages about what you were doing or were thinking about. Then other people could follow you and see your messages and you could follow other people. You only saw messages from people you followed, so you could control how much you wanted to monitor. And people could choose to follow you (and if someone creepy was following you then you could block them). <p>But, in the last six months or so I have been really starting to use Twitter for actual business use and found it really helpful. This is mainly because of the quality of people that are using it which makes it valuable to follow them. There are at least three types of people I follow: (1) <strong>industry leaders</strong> (people who are leading the way in technologies or trends that I care about), (2) <strong>acquaintances</strong> (people you’ve met a handful of times and want to keep in touch with, and may occasionally e-mail), and (3) <strong>peers</strong> (people who you know by name and face and could e-mail or call up as needed). <p>So Twitter is really about half-way between e-mail and IM, with a little \"blogishness\" thrown in. It is asynchronous so you don’t have to be online at the same time as other people, but also nearly real-time as you can react or respond to messages within minutes or hours of their sending. It is much lighter than blogging (say what you are going to say in 140 characters or less), but has been called \"microblogging\" as it is a stream of ideas and thoughts that map to an individual. <p>So what are the practical \"use cases\" for Twitter in business? Here are a few.  <p>(1) When you are stuck in a technical or programming problem and could use some outside help. Spamming your closest friends with your issue might be a solution here but you certainly wouldn’t e-mail lesser known people and bother them. You probably wouldn’t blog about each thing you are working on or having issues with either. But with Twitter you can put up a short message about what you are doing and see what might come back. Conversely you can occasionally monitor “the feed” to see what others are working on and see how you might be able to respond or help out.&nbsp; But on a busy day you just let the posts flow by without feeling the inferred obligation that an e-mail might create or the interruption of an IM. <p>(2) Stating what you are learning about or trying out for the first time. Then others may be able to recommend books or resources on the topic, or remember to contact you when they go down that road in the future. <p>(3) Communicate about local events that people may be interested in attending or hearing about.&nbsp; When/where/why/who <p>(4) Follow industry current events and announcements that may have an impact on what you are doing. You can’t get to every conference, presentation or other industry event but you can follow those that are attending and/or presenting. <p>(5) Words of wisdom or wit to inspire and amuse people and remind us that we are all still human. <p>(6) And just plain staying connected with the wide world of people who share some type of interest with you (or following those who have taken a different path than you to be able to compare and contrast your positions). <p>This all being said, there is a lot of junk out there and I have stopped following a people because of the quantity or content of their messages. But that is the beauty of Twitter – the opt-in, opt-out nature – that and the short messages (it is a real skill to say a lot in a little space). You can easily keep up with your timeline/stream in under a minute and it takes even less time than that to update your current message or respond to someone. The time/value ratio is very high (in my opinion). <p>Anyway, if you are on Twitter or are considering it, my Twitter ID is \"babernethy\". If not I still e-mail, blog and IM.</p>','Why I like Twitter','','publish','open','open','','why-i-like-twitter','','','2008-02-13 03:41:20','2008-02-13 03:41:20','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Why-I-like-Twitter.aspx',0,'post','',3),(79,2,'2008-02-10 14:26:45','2008-02-10 14:26:45','<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/ShuttleLaunchExperience_12D64/shuttle_pad_2.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"285\" alt=\"shuttle_pad\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/ShuttleLaunchExperience_12D64/shuttle_pad_thumb.png\" width=\"260\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\" /></a> Well it is easy to say that one of the highlights of my Florida vacation was the launch of the Space Shuttle (STS-122).&#160; </p>  <p>We visited the Kennedy Space Center the day before the launch (which is an amazingly worthwhile trip even without a launch if you are in the area).&#160; Having been to Universal Studios the week before, much of what is at KSC was very similar.&#160; There are &quot;edutainment&quot; shows and 3D movies (IMAX and on stage), rides that simulate the Shuttle Launch, expensive food, and lots to do.</p>  <p>The more interesting parts&#160; to me was on the bus tour (3-4 hours worth at three different stops along the way).&#160; I wont detail all the stuff in this post, other than to say that the first stop was quite close to the Shuttle launch pad (39b), the second is at a building where they completely enclosed and restored a full Saturn V rocket (amazing), and the last is the Space Station prep and assembly building.&#160; The amazing thing about this last stop is that you actually walk through a glassed in hallway overlooking the actual assembly of the final Space Station parts (can\'t even use flash photography (no-flash is ok) because you could damage some of the components being assembled).</p>  <p>The thing that struck me the most about the whole experience at KSC is how &quot;possible&quot; all of what NASA is doing seems to me now - in contrast to when I was there last (30 years ago).&#160; None of the science, physics, chemistry, engineering or computer processing seem as unattainable or &quot;magic&quot; as they once did.&#160; Newton\'s laws make sense, Oxygen and Hydrogen combine and burn in powerful (but understood) ways.&#160; Radar and GPS systems can track things well.&#160; Computers can process millions of instructions per second (in a $300 game system now). Think about the Shuttle - it is basically 1970/80s design and engineering brought forward with some advances as needed.&#160; The Shuttle fleet is being retired very soon - Atlantis will soon become &quot;spare parts&quot; for the rest of the Shuttles (this is one of its last flights).&#160; They are even &quot;reverse engineering&quot; much of the Saturn V technology to help design the new Ares series of launch vehicles for future missions.&#160; I mean the amount of brainpower and ability needed to safely get people to space and back is still amazing (astounding really) but now it seems like it would just be really hard to accomplish, not impossible.&#160; When my kids talk about possibly being part of the missions in the 2020s and 2030s I tell them that it is really possible - and mean it - more on this later.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/ShuttleLaunchExperience_12D64/shuttle_2.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"532\" alt=\"shuttle\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/ShuttleLaunchExperience_12D64/shuttle_thumb.png\" width=\"261\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\" /></a>On to the launch. We were able to view it from the Kennedy Space Center the next day, about 7 miles from the launch site.&#160; We got there really early (too early) at about 7:30am (passes said no later than 8:00) and got a great parking place.&#160; We went in and picked up the IMAX 3D Space Station movie that we passed on the day before.&#160; </p>  <p>We were told there was about a 25% chance of launch that day.&#160; The weather accounted for most of this (a cold front coming through with rain) and the pressure sensors that had failed several times before were still &quot;iffy&quot;.&#160; I decided to park in the bleachers by the countdown clock and &quot;jumbotron&quot; and watch the whole thing unfold throughout the day.&#160; There were many astronauts and other NASA folks sharing information and experiences and it was really interesting.</p>  <p>But 5 hours in 86 degree heat in direct sun wears on you after a while - especially when you are from Michigan and not used to the heat.&#160; My wife and kids left me early on to see some shows and stay out of the heat.&#160; I gave up after the astronauts were settled (the sit there for 2+ hours after they are hooked up basically doing nothing - one astronaut who was speaking told us he slept for most of that time (which I found hard to believe).&#160; He shared a great story I should recount sometime later.</p>  <p>Finally it came to time for the launch - all the weather had blown north, the sensors held up just fine, and we were 9 minutes from launch.&#160; We found a good place to view from and waited.&#160; The countdown came and then it happened.&#160; Wow.</p>  <p>I\'ve seen many launches on TV but always wanted to be there live and I have to tell you it is something that is nearly impossible to express in words, pictures, or even video - but I\'ll try.&#160; </p>  <p>The first thing I noticed as being different than all the other launches I\'ve seen is the fire coming out of the rockets - no picture can really capture it.&#160; When you view a picture or a poster on the wall you really only see the reflected light from sources in the room.&#160; When you view a computer screen you see light transmitted outward in different colors.&#160; To really understand how the fire looked you need both.&#160; A fully illuminated poster for all the details of the sky and the trees and the smoke, but also a source of light nearly as bright as the sun coming from the rocket like the flame of a candle in a dark room.&#160; It was strikingly bright - it\'d be &quot;overdone&quot; if it were a special effect - too bright to look at for very long.&#160; You just get captivated by it watching it go up until the fire is obscured by the clouds of smoke as it gets higher up.</p>  <p>The other thing that really struck me was the sound - even miles away you really &quot;felt&quot; the sound more than &quot;heard it&quot;.&#160; It is said that any living thing within 1000ft of the launch pad will be killed by the sound waves alone (the birds know when to leave).&#160; I imagine an 10,000 watt IMAX THX 10,2 sound system could start to approximate what it sounded/felt like.&#160; You also notice the sound trailing off as the Shuttle gets higher and higher up.&#160; Very cool.</p>  <p>We were also able to see the solid rocked boosters (SRBs) detach from the shuttle and fall, like little white specs, back to the earth.&#160; We\'d seen that several times the previous day in the Shuttle Simulator and models, so to see it happen live was a real treat.</p>  <p>One other unexpected result of coming to the live launch came much later on that night when we were going to the pool back at the hotel.&#160; It just-so-happened that we were staying at a hotel that NASA had put a number of people up at and we had noticed the meeting notices in the lobby for NASA,USA (United Space Alliance), and Boeing.&#160; When my daughter and I were fetching her goggles from the room we ran into an older man getting on to the elevator.&#160; He had a STS-122 embroidered shirt so I asked him if he had seen the launch earlier that day.&#160; He said &quot;yes&quot; and that his son was one of the astronauts who was on the Shuttle that day.&#160; He was clearly experiencing many different emotions all at one time - I shook his hand (in my Coco Beach t-shirt and swim trunks) and congratulated him.&#160; My daughter looked at me and said something I don\'t really recall exactly, but the idea of it was &quot;So you said we could actually be involved with space missions in the future, and that guy\'s son just took off - that could be you in the future?&quot; &quot;Um, yes, that\'s right .....&quot;</p>  <p>Sometimes we tell kids that they can go as far as their talents, gifts and determination can take them, and to be honest sometimes we (I) say it half-heartedly or just simply as encouragement.&#160; This day it became very real.</p>','Shuttle Launch Experience','','publish','open','open','','shuttle-launch-experience','','','2008-02-10 14:26:45','2008-02-10 14:26:45','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Shuttle-Launch-Experience.aspx',0,'post','',2),(80,2,'2008-02-10 04:17:00','2008-02-10 04:17:00','<iframe src=\"http://www.flickr.com/slideShow/index.gne?group_id=&amp;user_id=81289351@N00&amp;set_id=&amp;text=\" width=\"450\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n','Florida Photos','','publish','open','open','','florida-photos','','','2008-02-10 04:17:00','2008-02-10 04:17:00','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Florida-Photos.aspx',0,'post','',0),(81,2,'2008-02-05 06:20:32','2008-02-05 06:20:32','<p>Posting images has been troublesome because it is as if I am working over a 56k modem right now, but should have better access later today.</p>  <p>Basically we are in Coco Beach (<a title=\"http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/hotels/five_day_forecast.jhtml?ctyhocn=CCBCHHF\" href=\"http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/hotels/five_day_forecast.jhtml?ctyhocn=CCBCHHF\">http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/hotels/five_day_forecast.jhtml?ctyhocn=CCBCHHF</a> ) and are T-minus 2 days to launch of the Space Shuttle launch to take the Columbus science lab to the Space Station (<a title=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/index.html\" href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/index.html\">http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/index.html</a> )</p>  <p>We just spent a nice (Internet-free) 4 days in Clearwater Beach (across the state) and had some great beach time, boat time, and exploring (more on that soon).</p>','Vacation Update','','publish','open','open','','vacation-update','','','2008-02-05 06:20:32','2008-02-05 06:20:32','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Vacation-Update.aspx',0,'post','',0),(82,2,'2008-02-05 06:13:32','2008-02-05 06:13:32','<p>Very limited Internet access (and even more limited bandwidth) than expected, but a few ideas/issues from the road (before they leave my short-term memory).</p>  <p>Here are two ideas for services that seem inevitable after a few experiences on vacation.</p>  <p>1) Government dictated (or business-standard) regulation to limit the personal information stored as consumer information - especially related to customer purchases.&#160; It will probably have opt-in/opt-out capability.&#160; Think of it as a HIPAA for retail business.&#160; The motivation for this is the ever-increasing amount of fraud with identity and credit information.&#160; </p>  <p>Motivation/inspiration for this?&#160; Several things, but it really hit me when the gas pump I put my credit card into this morning asked me for my zip code (and potentially other information).&#160; First the expiration date had to match the number on the card (and the date wasn\'t supposed to be stored).&#160; Next the name had to match the card.&#160; Then, for shipped items, the address on the card had to match the address being shipped to.&#160; Then there was the &quot;security code&quot; on the back of the card (which, again, wasn\'t supposed to be stored).&#160; Now to get $60 in gas, the gas station has my name (from the card), the card number, expiration date, and now my zip code (which is a protected field under HIPAA in certain circumstances, as are the rest).&#160; In the short term, the added zip code requirement will catch some stolen cards, but then they will need something else.</p>  <p>The main issue here is that some random Shell station in mid-Florida now has just about all the information they need to not only use my credit card, but order a new card, or get a loan in my name.&#160; This shouldn\'t be necessary, and is getting out of control.&#160; Something will be needed soon or there could be a huge backlash to cash (which wouldn\'t be such a bad thing anyway).</p>  <p>2) The second thing that I think is needed is some kind of clearinghouse of employment information for employers and employees.&#160; This would probably also need a government element to be effective.&#160;&#160; Think of it as a &quot;Monster.com&quot; combined with &quot;Linked-In&quot; with some government validation.&#160; One motivation for this would be to insure that people are minimally allowed to work.&#160; Non-native workers would need to be registered&#160; in order to work, as would minors with a work permit.</p>  <p>Another big motivator could be that it is estimated that that 80%+ of people have false information on their resumes or lie in job interviews.&#160; To have particular parts of a potential employees history (e.g. education, work history, etc.) verified digitally by a certified source would eliminate a lot of fraud from the process and get further into the interview process much faster.&#160; Right now some professional certifications (e.g. Microsoft) can be verified by an employer when an employee gives them a one-use code to their transcript.&#160; A similar model could be used to validate employment-eligibility status as well as education and work history.&#160; The ability to have authorized agents validate the information increases the quality of the information for future use.&#160; Some of my first jobs and special experience were at companies that no longer exist, and for people I have long lost track of.</p>  <p>Right now people who use the unemployment benefits have to use a similar system to track their employment search and can also be used to match people with positions that are posted. The problem will become when registration with this type of system becomes required for particular jobs.</p>  <p>Jobs in personal privacy and data integrity will be ever-growing with the digitization of virtually all information going forward.</p>','A few coming privacy / personal information services','','publish','open','open','','a-few-coming-privacy-personal-information-services','','','2008-02-05 06:13:32','2008-02-05 06:13:32','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/A-few-coming-privacy-personal-information-services.aspx',0,'post','',1),(83,2,'2008-01-31 14:12:48','2008-01-31 14:12:48','<p>When was the last time you heard someone say, in real life, that something &quot;delighted&quot; them, or it was &quot;delightful&quot;.&#160; If you are like me it has not happened in recent memory.&#160; But the word seems to keep coming up on vacation so I\'ve been thinking a lot about it.</p>  <p>First, being at the Universal parks in Orlando this week has almost been like visiting a foreign country.&#160; There are literally 2-3 times as many people here from Europe or Eastern Europe than there are from the USA - and they aren\'t the most populous group.&#160; The #1 language spoken in the park this week, by a factor of 10, is Portuguese - the Brazilian Portuguese (which apparently is as different from the Portuguese from Portugal as the Spanish spoken in Mexico is different from the Spanish spoken in Spain (and perhaps the English spoken in the USA is from the &quot;Queen\'s English&quot;)).</p>  <p>I\'ll go with this tangent for a second.&#160; Brazil is on &quot;summer vacation&quot; right now and there are work-study groups that bring college-aged kids to the USA as tour groups (for fun for a while) and then they work in the park until late March when they return home at the end of their work/study visa.&#160; This seems like a huge win-win for all - there are tons of paying customers at Universal from Brazil (they even have their own printed materials, maps, signs, etc.) and there are nice student workers who speak the language and are willing to put in the long hours away from home.&#160; I got to speak to several of them this week and my view has changed a bit about what it means to the economy in the USA to have foreign workers (here legally, paying taxes, etc.).&#160; The issue is much deeper, but the many hundreds of Brazilians here, for the most part, were very well received.</p>  <p>Anyway, back to &quot;delight&quot; - the first mention of it was from a British woman speaking about how enjoyable one of the rides was.&#160; (BTW, some of the British families here make &quot;the Dursleys&quot; look well-adjusted).&#160; Next came this kiosk.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/LostEnglishworddelight_12EDB/delights_2.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"298\" alt=\"delights\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/LostEnglishworddelight_12EDB/delights_thumb.png\" width=\"459\" border=\"0\" /></a> </p>  <p>It was a &quot;fruity drink&quot; vendor (hard to keep hydrated in the 82 degree heat .... how\'s the snow?) And it occurred to me that the word &quot;delight&quot; often comes in the context of food (e.g. Turkish Delight).&#160; </p>  <p>But what does &quot;delight&quot; mean?&#160; Why isn\'t the word used much?&#160; It seems antiquated or &quot;stuffy&quot; when you say it out loud.&#160; I think there is something here though - something that has maybe been lost and needs to return.</p>  <p>I am hooked on the word - I want to &quot;delight&quot; people with the work and things that I do.&#160; I want to do more than &quot;meet expectations&quot; and have people be visibly pleased with what I\'ve done.&#160; Don\'t want to &quot;shock&quot; people or &quot;surprise&quot; people, but go the extra mile and bring a smile to their face.</p>  <p>I\'ll write more on this once I\'ve thought it through a bit more about it - I have some ideas.&#160; It isn\'t easy, and takes extra time and effort.&#160; But it certainly is hard to compete against, and would be impossible to automate or outsource, and is just plain good for everyone.</p>  <p>Headed for the beach for 4 days, and then on to Cape Canaveral for a hopeful launch of STS-122 (watching a bent hose that has got some attention lately,and then back home.&#160;

The launch is scheduled for after 2:00pm, but they want you to get there by 9:00am.&#160; No one is allowed into the access roads on the day of the launch without a placard in the front window.&#160; Then you need a photo id that matches the names on the tickets and a whole bunch of security precautions that make the TSA sound reasonable.&#160; No bags or backpacks of any kind, metal detectors, purses if necessary but with a full search, and all the &quot;pointy stuff&quot; restrictions (but you can bring a telescope).</p>  <p>They lock the gates two hours before launch and no one can get in or out until an hour after the launch.&#160; I am glad it is not summer and &quot;only&quot; 70 down there - most of the waiting and all of the viewing is outside basically in a field.&#160; A whole lot of waiting for a pretty cool event.&#160; I guess they have a big-screen outside with close-ups and all the launch info.&#160;

(sometimes by almost a year).&#160; So you collect the one(s) that is being put out to pasture and get replacement(s).</p>  <p>Now what do you do with the old ones?&#160; You clearly can\'t just throw them in the trash - they can/will explode when they get compressed.</p>  <p>I found a little <a href=\"http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/apps/dpwt/solidwaste/collectionservices/material_detail.asp?categoryID=27\">advice online</a>...</p>  <li>Place the extinguisher into two heavy duty plastic trash bags. </li>  <li>Outdoors, lay the bag with the extinguisher flat on level ground. </li>  <li>Fold the tops of the bags closed and with one foot, step on the fold. </li>  <li>With a free hand, find the extinguisher\'s release lever from outside the bags. Gently squeeze and slowly release its contents. </li>  <li>Knot or tie the bags closed and place them into your regular household trash.    <p>While this makes sense, and would work for this type of home fire extinguisher, it sure seems like a waste of a perfectly good fire extinguisher.</p>    <p>When thinking about this I was quickly reminded of Gever Tulley\'s TED talk called &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/202\">5 dangerous things you should let your kids do</a>&quot; (which actually ends up being a talk about safety).&#160; One of the things he promotes is to let your kids, in the appropriate time and place (with supervision), start a fire - it\'s Boy Scouts 101 - teach them to do things in the safe and proper way and you will have much less to worry about than if they end up experimenting and trying to figure it out on their own (without supervision).&#160; So why not start a small fire in a fire pit somewhere and then put it out with the fire extinguisher?&#160; I have to say I have never set off one of the white powdery fire extinguishers before, though I\'ve been through a bunch of training/explanation on them.&#160; I have fired the water-based ones in college, but that is a whole other story.</p>    <p>I don\'t want to ever give my kids the impression that they should not flee a fire, or have them take undo risks if they were in a crisis.&#160;

Sure there are Geek Squads and FireDogs now associated with big-box stores, but will there be room for a \"profession\" for computer help in the home.</p> <p>I say yes.&nbsp; This week Apple announced two new \"appliances\" for the home - the \"Time Capsule\" (home server) and \"Apple TV\" (2).&nbsp; Essentially these are two devices you need never really \"see\" you just \"use\" them.&nbsp; Like the already announced Microsoft Home Server, the market is realizing that people are amassing large amounts of important digital files (e.g. digital pictures, media, tax forms, etc.) and need to back them up.&nbsp; The other is basically a device to watch/listen to your media (oh and \"rent\" digital movies, and watch hi-def movies without having to choose HD-DVD or Blue-Ray (and who wants to store physical discs and cases anyway?)).</p> <p>A large portion of the population \"needs\" to do backups and watch TV/movies/audio.&nbsp; But a large portion of them is not technically capable of setting things up or, in increasing numbers, simply wants \"someone else\" to help them out.</p> <p>In the \"olden-days\" personal computers were built by hobbyists, and the Internet was something a handful of geeks and researchers did over a slow modem connection.&nbsp; Now PCs (and more often laptops) are as common as TVs, and homes are built pre-wired (or wireless) for Internet connections.&nbsp; More importantly computers (and servers/appliances) need to be setup and configured in the home, and they need to be maintained.&nbsp; This is evidenced by the \"pain\" I have witnessed in poor individuals who have lost their Internet connection for \"almost a week\" or had one (or more) hard drives die on their computers.&nbsp; These people can feel quite helpless, as if their pipes have burst.</p> <p>So now I am thinking there are at least two public professions ready for talented individuals.&nbsp; Since the computer industry often borrows terms from \"real\" professions (e.g. Architects, Engineers, etc.) why not call them \"Handyman\" and \"Plumber\".&nbsp; </p> <p>The \"Handyman\" is the creative proactive role - help people with their dream house - set up a wireless network with great coverage of all their property, wire up the Internet connection, set up the \"server closet\", set up the entertainment center in all its glory, maybe even configure the universal remote (home automation?).&nbsp; This would be a lot of fun, and everyone would be happy - there is good money in happy.</p> <p>But then things also go wrong - you need a \"Plumber\".&nbsp; Hard drives fail (all do eventually, if you\'ve got &gt;3-4 years on one, you are on borrowed time), viruses and other malware are common, upgrades are necessary or desired, Internet connections fail (and foreign tech support is rarely helpful), and bad things happen at the worst time.&nbsp; Sometimes it is a simple fix and people are back up and running.&nbsp; Other times the sad truth needs to be spoken and drastic measures have to be taken - there is good money in desperate drastic measures.</p> <p>Man.&nbsp; I do \"computer stuff\" every day, have built 4-5 of computers from parts, and seemingly install an operating system on a computer every few weeks.&nbsp; But, even in writing this, I wish I knew a good Handyman or Plumber to call on when I am at the end of my rope.</p> <p>I also know I am neither of these people (so this isn\'t an announcement or advertisement) - I love software and development too much.&nbsp;

which would be a reasonable guess for a non-programmer.&nbsp; What I intended though was a programming language - but now that I come down to writing it, I think I&#39;ll do both.&nbsp; \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFirst, programming language - I program mostly in C#, which seems like a relatively new language (even though it is 7 years old now - though if it got an &quot;upgrade&quot; a month or so ago).&nbsp; Programming languages have a definite life-span so the next programming language has got to be out there somewhere.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if it is F#, D, or Ruby (or another dynamic language, IronRuby?), or a robotics language (see below) like NXT-G (from Lego), VPL (Microsoft&#39;s Visual Programming Language).&nbsp; I&#39;ve used Java, Perl, C++ and the like in the past, but haven&#39;t really used PHP.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#39;d like to spend some non-trivial time learning and working with the new language - enough to be able to explain it to others.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNext, I think I&#39;d like to get into studying and speaking some Spanish around the house.&nbsp; My kids have sampled several languages and learned vocabulary and simple phrases, but it&#39;d be nice to go a little deeper.&nbsp; This wouldn&#39;t technically be &quot;new&quot; since I studied Spanish a bit before, but not since the 80s and it still seems to be the most practical language to spend time learning (don&#39;t see a real influx of people from Quebec that I need to be able to communicate with).&nbsp; I have a really old version of Latin Spanish Rosetta Stone software (not that the language has changed much) and some educational CDs.&nbsp; I&#39;ll have to check out the library to see what might be newer - any ideas?\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>New Goal (#4): Robotics</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nI&#39;ve been putting this off for a while, but I think now it is time.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been interfacing robots with computers since high school and I rally enjoy working with them.&nbsp; It is really awesome to see a project actually move around, physically do something, and perhaps even create something (or at least perform a task).&nbsp; With all the &quot;physical UI&quot; stuff going on (e.g. Wii controllers, laptop/Chumby accelerometers, touch screens, integrated audio/video, etc.) this will really have a place in technology development going forward.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI got to watch a LEGO Robotics team this fall go through some of their projects, and picked up a LEGO NXT for Christmas (for the children of course - don&#39;t have one for me (yet)).&nbsp; I want to be involved with a LEGO team/club this year (perhaps lead or start one).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMicrosoft also has their Microsoft Robotics Studio now which opens up a bunch of other options as well.&nbsp; I&#39;ve build an RFID reader and touch-screen kiosk in recent years, so now is time to add some motion and intelligence to some projects.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is definitely one I want to pursue right along-side my kids so that will be great as well. \r\n</p>\r\n','2008 Goals - Take 1','','publish','open','open','','2008-goals-take-1','','','2008-01-04 05:17:00','2008-01-04 05:17:00','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/2008-Goals-Take-1.aspx',0,'post','',2),(98,2,'2008-01-03 09:06:07','2008-01-03 09:06:07','<p>I\'ve been reading and listening to other people\'s review of last year, and setting goals for the next year.&nbsp; I\'m not typically a \"resolution setter\" but I do remember last January having the typical thoughts flow through my head.&nbsp; Here\'s a brief rundown of 2007, and I\'ll post soon about 2008. <p>In January 2007, I realized that drive-time radio was messing with my head. If it was talk radio I either learned all kinds of trivia that I didn’t need to know anyway, or just wanted to argue with the next human I saw about whatever they were debating about that day on the radio. If it was music it was never the music I really wanted to listen to anyway and there were still a bunch of commercials which are never fun. So whenever I got where I was going I was never quite in the same state-of-mind that I was in when I started the trip, which I didn’t like. My solution was just to turn it all off – so I did. The first 6 months of this year my car radio did not come on at all and it was honestly really peaceful. I’ve had it on maybe 10 times since then, mostly for traffic, weather or a little Christmas music. Since 2008 is an election year I am sure they will be arguing or debating all the time on the radio again, and in between there will be political ads on all the channels, so I’m keeping with the radio free zone. I do have my iPod(s) that I load up with music I want to listen to and podcasts that I have subscribed to. The weather is pretty obvious out the window, and my drive is much less complicated now, so I won’t miss out on much. This was really positive.  <p>Next I wanted to learn a lot more about some new technologies that Microsoft has come out with – the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). I spent last year reading a ton about it, doing projects on the side, and even going to a training class in Chicago. I wanted to learn it even more and start to spread the word about it to more people. So I presented at the Day of .NET conference in the spring and lead a summer special-interest group (GRUISIG) that met six times with 5-12 people who were also interested in learning together. I’d consider this a positive result as well. I always want to be part of a group of people who is learning things together. I’ll keep attending the .NET User group, and plan to be learning and working with a group as well this year (more on that later). <p>I wanted to get more active – personally and with my kids. We got new bikes for everyone that needed one, a bike carrier for the van, and actually went on some good longer rides together (and more shorter ones too). But we easily could have done more / should have done more - so I need to do better here this year. We also painted the lines on the driveway for some basketball games and did get out there maybe 10-12 times. We didn’t go camping and really didn’t do much hiking / nature walks as we’d talked about. So we laid some good ground work this year, but clearly fell short of really ramping up the activity. This is moving forward into 2008 <p>Professionally, again, I wanted to update my Microsoft certification. I’d been studying with a group from work since the fall for one of the tests and I figured I could knock out three tests without too much trouble. I know people go back and forth about the value of a Microsoft developer certification. I have known several people with all kinds of paper certifications that really didn’t execute very well at all. I also know some awesome developers who haven’t taken any tests at all. Microsoft certification is really part of the puzzle (and certainly not the most important part). But I know, personally, preparing for the tests and taking them has really helped me (I’ve taken 7 now – passed 5). I learned many things studying for the tests that I would not have learned when working on the projects that I have been on or in the books that I have read. I know for a fact that many of the things I learned while studying helped me design and program projects that came later (and solve problems in between). Anyway, I passed one test and prepared for a second. I’d like to get the other two tests done in 2008. <p>Well, I\'d give myself 7 of 10 for the year - let\'s look forward to 2008 next.</p>','2007\'s Resolutions in Review','','publish','open','open','','2007s-resolutions-in-review','','','2008-01-03 09:06:07','2008-01-03 09:06:07','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/2007s-Resolutions-in-Review.aspx',0,'post','',2),(99,2,'2008-01-03 00:15:44','2008-01-03 00:15:44','<p>A friend (who shall remain nameless) sent a link to an article after we had several discussions this season about Christmas and Santa (yes we both have kids).&nbsp; If you still believe (or find the whole discussion about the issue(s) tedious) then come back tomorrow.&nbsp; I hate reading blog posts and articles like this, and can\'t believe I wrote one, but when ideas get stuck in my head they need some way to get out or my head will explode.</p> <p>I read New Scientist (used to subscribe) so an article from them is usually worth checking out - even if it is titled \"<a href=\"http://media.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19626351.500-the-santa-delusion.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Santa delusion, is it harmless fantasy or cruel deception</a>.\" </p> <p>The article contains the typical arguments over the psychological impact of the moment a child learns the \"truth\" about Santa (typically between 6-10) - nothing really new here except more assertions that kids who find out the latest in life can have the biggest impacts.</p> <p>The part that kept/keeps me thinking is the whole social/economic angle of how the \"American Santa\" has differed from other International renditions.&nbsp; I remember working in retail how fierce and heated the marketing was during the holiday season was - it really bugged me, to tell the truth.&nbsp; In many ways the health of the nation\'s economy will be judged by how well retailers did around Christmas. So it is almost \"anti-American\" to discuss this, and I know it verges on a \"conspiracy theory\", but could Santa have been adapted over time for this purpose (at least for the sake of argument)?</p> <p>The article\'s premise is built on the words of John Kremer on the work of George Homans ...</p> <blockquote> <p>... who argued decades ago that all social relationships are based on reciprocity and the balancing of rewards and cost. This is starkly revealed at Christmas, says Kremer. Each gift must be carefully matched in value with another, each card must be met with a card, or you risk embarrassment or worse. \'Children find themselves in this intricate web of exchange without the necessary social skills, nor indeed the resources, to become active participants.\'</p> <p>Santa is the perfect solution. \"Because Santa gives presents to children but expects nothing in return, he protects them from the minefield of social exchange known as Christmas,\" Kremer says. \"This allows children to learn the ropes of gift-giving, without having to play an active role.\"</p></blockquote> <p>Who hasn\'t felt awkward at one time or another at Christmas when giving/getting a gift that is clearly of a different value than the one going the other way?&nbsp; Did you ever, as a child of course, \"do the math\" to figure out if your brother/sister did equally well at Christmas? How many times are identical gifts purchased for siblings to make the fairness completely obvious.&nbsp; I think the \"reciprocity and balancing of rewards and cost\" is an accurate (if simplistic) description of many social relationships.</p> <p>From a cultural outsider looking critically inward to American Christmas traditions, it looks like capitalism run amok.&nbsp; So how do people across the country arrive at this strange belief that they must buy equal or better gifts for a variety of people once a year - even when doing so can break budgets and max-out credit cards?&nbsp; Enter Santa.&nbsp; For a period of their lives (i.e. the pre-income-earning stage) they will be on the receiving end of significant gifts from a mysterious and magical person who expects nothing in return.&nbsp; Then at the appropriate age the myth will be revealed and you enter into the true capitalistic social system of \"reciprocity and balancing\".&nbsp; In short you have been initiated into a \"materialistic culture\".</p> <p>The author\'s recommendation? \"You could resist the tide of commercialism and limit Santa\'s gifts to the traditional orange and sweets in a stocking. Trouble is, it may not bring you much in the way of peace and goodwill.\"</p> <p>And that then is the issue.&nbsp; Even if it is sad that many social relationships are built on the \"reciprocity and balancing of rewards and cost\" it is still very true - you will have more/better friends if you buy them more/better presents - and you will look really \"cheap\" if you give a nice big orange and candy cane to everyone.&nbsp; Also, if too many people opted-out of the clearly commercial segment of the holidays, our country would probably fall into an economic recession or worse.&nbsp; </p> <p>Surely there is room for generosity and giving around Christmastime.&nbsp; But how do we keep our kids (and ourselves) focused on the act of giving without the expectation of something in return.&nbsp; I\'ve seen the look of disappointment in my own kids eyes when surveying their presents, so I know I\'ve passed on some of this to them (I know I have it in me). But I\'ve also seen the joy in their eyes when giving and serving other people.&nbsp; The later is what I want to focus on bringing out in years to come as it sure reflects better the true meaning of Christmas.</p> <p>Man that got long .... um, Merry Christmas</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cognitive-edge.com/blogs/dave/2008/01/the_santa_delusion.php\">Cognitive Edge: The Santa Delusion</a></p>','New Scientist: The Santa Delusion','','publish','open','open','','new-scientist-the-santa-delusion','','','2008-01-03 00:15:44','2008-01-03 00:15:44','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/New-Scientist-The-Santa-Delusion.aspx',0,'post','',1),(100,2,'2008-01-02 22:59:36','2008-01-02 22:59:36','<p>Sure, plan a trip to Florida and watch the record cold weather creep in.</p> <h3>Current Temps:</h3> <blockquote> <p>Pensacola - balmy 24 degrees (12 wind chill)</p> <p>Destin - 26 / 14</p> <p>Jacksonville - 26 /15</p></blockquote> <h3>Surely further south will be nice ....</h3> <blockquote> <p>Clearwater - 32 / 21</p> <p>Kennedy Space Center - 36 / 26</p></blockquote> <h3>Waaay down ....</h3> <blockquote> <p>Miami - 39 / 31</p> <p>Key West - 45 / 36</p></blockquote>It\'s hard to believe that the current temperature in Key West will be exceeded (according to the forecast) here in Grand Rapids by Monday.','Florida Freeze','','publish','open','open','','florida-freeze','','','2008-01-02 22:59:36','2008-01-02 22:59:36','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Florida-Freeze.aspx',0,'post','',2),(101,2,'2008-01-02 05:39:16','2008-01-02 05:39:16','<p>For various reasons we haven\'t taken a vacation (of more than a long weekend) in several years.&nbsp;

Of course it would be this week that Florida is under \"freeze warnings\", but that\'ll be over soon (might be in the 50s by Monday here even).</p> <p>So I\'m looking for input, and I need it fast, for what to do \"south of Michigan\" and what to do on the drive down.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/HeadingSouthAnyIdeas_C000/vacation_map_2.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px;

First we went south-southeast and spent some time in Indianapolis, Nashville and Chattanooga (red on the map).&nbsp; Next we went to Florida via Charleston, Hilton Head, Jacksonville, St. Augustine, to Orlando (Disney / Sea World) (blue on the map).&nbsp; Then we went to Williamsburg/Jamestown/Yorktown, Virginia Beach, Chincoteague/Asateague, Lancaster, Gettysburg, etc. </p> <p>My gut feeling this time was to head \"straight down\" to wherever that hit salt water and then follow the gulf-coast down into Florida (the striped yellow line).&nbsp; Then we\'d at least \"add a state\" to our list (i.e. Alabama) and see roads and sites we haven\'t seen before.&nbsp; Half the fun of driving is taking it a little slower (6-9 hours a day) and seeing what is \"in between\" the scheduled stops.&nbsp; While we will certainly end up in Florida, I\'d like to see if there are things in Kentucky, Tennessee, and now Alabama that we haven\'t seen before (what is in Alabama?&nbsp; Birmingham?, Montgomery?, Mobile?, Huntsville?).&nbsp; So if you\'ve been to Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama (especially with say 30 minutes of the yellow line) and have something interesting to recommend, I\'d be really interested in hearing about it.&nbsp; Also Florida pan-handle gulf-coast ideas would be great too.&nbsp; </p> <p>Once in Florida we can do Clearwater, Tampa, Orlando and on over to the ocean.&nbsp; The current Space Shuttle launch has been delayed quite a bit, and may actually be taking off during this time period.&nbsp;

I was looking online for a place to take my test when the \"PC ProSchools\" link came up as a possible test site.&nbsp; It turns out it is really close to me (I-96 and East Beltline) and is pretty new (too new for Google Maps - about a year old).</p> <p>I thought I knew of most of the Microsoft training facilities in town and had never heard of them.&nbsp; I got to my test about 15 minutes early and they were fully booked so I started asking about their programs and reading some of their material.&nbsp; I ended up getting a tour of the facilities and programs by a guy named Richard Fera (who was really helpful).</p> <p>They had a great training lab (room for 50 at brand new machines, dual projectors, dual stations in the back of the room for more trainers (3 trainers available in a full class)).&nbsp; They had an open lab and what looked like a server room / wiring closet (which turned out to be an \"advanced lab\" area).&nbsp; Their focus is on the infrastructure side (i.e. the MCSE route) on getting the servers up and running and all kinds of troubleshooting.&nbsp; They do not offer programs for software development (i.e. the MCPD route).&nbsp; So they had never heard of the test I was taking but it was pretty clear that their testing lab got quite a bit of use.</p> <p>They are a Microsoft Platinum Partner provider for training (which says a lot about volume, graduation rate, certification rate, and placement rate (&gt;70%)).&nbsp; It is an interesting model because they run it kind of like something between a technical trainer (i.e. offering one class at a time) and a college (full-blown multi-year program).&nbsp; They offer an intense one-year program which is open to any high-school graduate who meets some basic criteria.&nbsp; The classes are either M/W or T/Th (with a few Fridays thrown in for test-prep and labs) from 5:30-10:30, which is quite a bit of work.&nbsp; But in the end you should have your MCSE.</p> <p>Add to this that they also do placement and have jobs looking for people - placed 48 of the lass class of 50.</p> <p>Reading this post it sounds kind of like an advertisement, but it really isn\'t.&nbsp; I\'d write about any new resource class, school, book, etc. that could be helpful to people doing what I do (or supported the servers I need to run on) and do that fairly often.&nbsp; If I knew someone who was interested in servers and hardware, and looking for a job without committing 2-4 years to school, this seems like the kind of thing you\'d need to keep you on track and get it done quickly.&nbsp;

It really is the best single book on the topic now.&nbsp; I met both of the authors many years ago in Boston at a WinDev/DevelopMentor conference and they are both really talented programmers and communicators ...</em></p> <p>Programming WPF is probably the first book on WPF I ever read (the 1<sup>st</sup> Edition) and the last one (2<sup>nd</sup> Edition) I’ll be buying (which is a good thing, since I have 7 WPF-related books now). The first edition was a real treat because there was nothing else available a the time and Chris and Ian really hit some topics (like Databinding) very well - so well that they set the standard for books to come. As each pre-release of WPF came out they dutifully updated the XAML and Framework calls of all the examples from the book. But with the production version of the .NET 3.0 Framework there was so much more that programmers needed to know. Ian took the WPF show on the road and Chris listened to a lot of feedback from the developer community – the results of which really come out in this new edition. <p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition of Programming WPF comes in strong as the most complete text available on WPF. The authors’ diverse background lead to a great blend of clear and concise writing for a wide variety of topics. The introductory chapters are great for beginners just getting into the topic, but there is also a great deal of detail in the advanced chapters to get you well into topics such as: handling graphics, bitmaps, databinding (templates and stying), animations, 3D, text and flow documents, and more. <p>I like the way they take typically hard topics (e.g. Control Templates) and go deep with concrete examples and helpful code/apps like “Show Me The Template!” from Chapter 9. They also show that they understand “real programming” environments when they don’t just gloss over issues such as the interoperability of WPF and Windows Forms (which isn’t a stretch because they’ve written on Windows Forms as well). <p>A “taste of Silverlight” left me wanting more – maybe they’ll come together for a Silverlight book once 2.0 ships? The color section in the middle was helpful but awkward as you read through it when you get to the center of the book and see color versions of pictures you are already past and glimpse pictures of what is to come. I applaud the inclusion of only 32 pages of basic XAML syntax – enough to give you an understanding of the language but not so much as to take over the book (some books can end up being 1/3 to 1/2 syntax and framework references, which is why you install the MSDN Library and Intellisense). I wanted to see something about Expression Blend or even Design as these tools become important when doing good UI design, but at 800+ pages already there really isn’t room (and I don’t know what I would have cut to make room). <p>While several of the other WPF books have been good to read through and learn from, I can see the Programming WPF book being one that will become a reference book to return to when you have need for a certain feature of WPF. <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596510373/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img\">Amazon.com: Programming WPF: Books: Chris Sells,Ian Griffiths</a></p>','Programming WPF: Books: Chris Sells,Ian Griffiths','','publish','open','open','','programming-wpf-books-chris-sellsian-griffiths','','','2007-12-31 02:10:44','2007-12-31 02:10:44','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Programming-WPF-Books-Chris-Sells2cIan-Griffiths.aspx',0,'post','',1),(104,2,'2007-12-30 10:08:27','2007-12-30 10:08:27','<p>Well we\'ve officially amassed &gt;15,000 digital pictures since 2002 - that\'s ~8 a day so it isn\'t a crazy amount.&nbsp; I used to be able to back up to a DVD and get them all.&nbsp; Then a dual-layer DVD.&nbsp; Now I\'ll be using multiples of something to get a physical backup.</p> <p>I\'m wondering how people will deal with all their digital media when they get 30,000 or 100,000.&nbsp; We have a daily backup to a networked drive.&nbsp; Home servers for average consumers (even if just for backups) seems like it will be a necessity.&nbsp; I bought Adobe Elements 6.0 (w/ Premiere Elements 4.00) for the new laptop.&nbsp; This product does a decent job of handling the large amount of pictures and grouping/tagging/stacking them (and a great calendar feature with the picture\'s own data - great reason to set the date on your new digital camera).</p> <p>I\'d be interested if anyone else has a great way to deal with ~30Gb of images.&nbsp; How do you save them so you can find them?

Then you drain out the water/ice/snow/salt solution and have about 1 quart of surprisingly good ice cream to share (perfect for the 5 of us).</p> <p>We got the quart-sized blue ball, but I hear they have a bigger sized red \"Mega\" ball now.

Superintendent Kevin Konarska said the results show that businesses and schools need to send a common message -- that the economy will improve if people continue their schooling and provide a workforce with in-demand skills.</p></td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Interesting if you read it critically. Before the poll or the results are even given the writer (unnamed) frames the outcomes to be caused by the struggling economy - implying the results would be different if the economy was doing better.&nbsp; </p> <p>Next, Ed Sarpolus is the pollster who is responsible for conducting the poll for EPIC/MRA.&nbsp; But he not only conducts the survey and compiles the data, but he also presents his opinions on what needs to happen as a result.&nbsp; It is interesting that he does not recommend that the educational system (that 66%+ of people felt was failing) needs to change, but instead suggests we need to work on changing the \"culture\" to accept the \"importance\" of the failing educational system in the state.</p> <p>Then notice why he probably can\'t recommend changes and improvements in the educational system, the Kent Intermediate School District sponsored the study.&nbsp; They also don\'t recommend to improve the system to meet the needs of those polled.&nbsp; But rather to \"send a common message -- that the economy will improve if people continue their schooling...\" in a system that 66%+ of the people see as failing them right now.</p> <p>More <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=EPIC%2FMRA+Poll+Kent+Intermediate\">poll results</a></p> <ul> <li>Only one in four Michigan parents believe that getting a good education is essential to getting ahead in life.  <li>Nearly half of parents don\'t think everyone should have a college education nor do they trust the judgment of teachers and professors.  <li>Three out of five define the success of their children without reference to education or the ability to support themselves.</li></ul> <p>Different Poll - same group (EMR/MRA)</p> <ul> <li>EPIC-MRA poll shows only 34 percent of state residents believe she\'s [Governor Granholm] doing a good job as governor.</li></ul> <p>If I were reading these polls and data, I would say that the Governor should head up an effort to improve/redesign the school system to provide the skills and learning necessary for Michigan\'s children to succeed in today\'s (and tomorrow\'s) job market.&nbsp; Then we will have a workforce ready for the jobs that are desired, companies will want to come to Michigan, and the economy will improve.&nbsp; Then we\'ll have an improved school system and economy, and she could get 66%+ of the vote.</p> <p>We don\'t just need to get a public relations campaign together to convince the vast majority of Michigan citizens that they just need to \"believe\" in the current system (which they don\'t \"trust the judgement\" of and don\'t see as being \"essential\" or effective currently).&nbsp;

The #1 complaint I\'ve heard about Silverlight 1.0 was the lack of even a basic control set for creating common user interfaces (you could create your own, but we haven\'t had to do that since Windows 95 (and earlier)).&nbsp; Now they are adding common controls (i.e. textbox, radio buttons, tab controls, progress bar, grid, etc.) and the great WPF layout controls (i.e. grid, stackpanel) so people can just start programming their custom code instead of worrying about creating common controls and laying out the UI.</p> <p>Next, two-way databinding - love WPF databinding - nice.&nbsp; LINQ to XML.</p> <p>Also, Networking support - nice REST, RSS, WS data access, and the ability to do cross-domain network access (thank you) to access trusted sources outside your doman.</p> <p>Add to this ASP.NET Extensions to easily support integrating Silverlight within ASP.NET applications (pull it all together) and we\'re \"cooking with gas\".</p> <p>All I don\'t see from my wish list is nice tools for Silverlight integration with MOSS, but I\'m confident someone is looking at that pretty closely.</p> <p>Looks like early 2008 is shaping up very nicely for Rich Internet Applications .</p> <p>Bruce</p> <p>p.s.

Here\'s how to avoid this happening twice during the VS2008 install process.</p> <p>First, shut off any updates that may be coming down for Vista while you install VS2008.&nbsp; You will need to uninstall the beta software first, and if Vista decides it needs to reboot your box while the betas are uninstalling, then you are in a bind.&nbsp; In fact, you will need to re-install the beta first in order to have all the files it needs to uninstall the rest (kind of a pain).</p> <p>Second, the VS2008&nbsp;installer may hang when installing .Net Framework 3.5 (hang for hours) and if you hit \"Cancel\" it just says \"The Installer will cancel when it is done installing the .Net Framework 3.5\" which was the problem in the first place.&nbsp; So if you stop the install process the installer won\'t be happy again.&nbsp; Luckily you can download the .Net Framework 3.5 as a separate installer.&nbsp; Then if you install the Framework with its own installer, then the VS2008 installer will recognize that the Framework is already installed and not get hung up trying to install it.</p> <p>After that, the install goes pretty smoothly.</p> <p>I\'m still not happy with how my overall experience with Vista has been, and how much more productive (and less frustrated) I am using other Windows XP machines.&nbsp;

My car is a 2000, and will cross 100,000 miles soon, but it is more the $90/gallon and alternative energy thing that is taking up \"brainwidth\" lately.&nbsp; In 2008/9 I should be able to get a decent electric/alternative energy car in without having to make it myself.</p> <p>I remember when I was in grade school in the \"Energy Crunch\" of the early 70s that everyone was talking about solar/electric cars, and alternative/renewable energy.&nbsp; Predictions were made that in 25 years (by 2000) we the family car would not run on gasoline and power plants would not run on coal (and robots would clean our houses (Roomba?) and farm our fields).&nbsp; It seems like in the 80s and 90s we really dropped the ball after they found a number of huge oil deposits around the world and people started focusing more on the economy and national defense.&nbsp; Google/Wikipedia tells me there is an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F\">interesting documentary</a> I may need to get from the library.</p> <p>But the social aspect isn\'t really my point - I will be very disappointed if my next car isn\'t an electric or alternative energy vehicle.&nbsp; I am told I am the ideal candidate for an energy-efficient car.&nbsp; I have a short commute, can park in a garage, don\'t have to get above 50mph or travel more than 25-40 miles per day (seems to be a \"sweet spot\").&nbsp; We have the \"family van\" for longer trips and carrying more people and cargo.&nbsp; So I should be in great shape for a cool efficient car.</p> <p>But, I am \"underwhelmed\" by the current offerings and don\'t see any great ideas on the horizon.&nbsp; The Toyota Prius seems to be the \"postercar\" for this effort, but I really don\'t like it (not sure why) and don\'t have $100k for a <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/\">Tesla</a> (plus all the 2008 models are sold out).&nbsp;

They even showed how modern \"chemistry sets\" come with no chemicals at all (just some plastic \"labware\" and instructions on where to find the \"chemicals\" in most kitchens).&nbsp; There has to be some compromise possible between just making another vinegar/baking soda volcano and being called a terrorist for wanting to make a little contact explosive.&nbsp; Anyway ....</p> <p>I am sure they will rerun these - TiVo taped mine in the middle of the night.&nbsp; A few segments are available online.</p>','&quot;WIRED Science&quot; on PBS','','publish','open','open','','wired-science-on-pbs','','','2007-10-15 00:20:05','2007-10-15 00:20:05','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/quot3bWIRED-Sciencequot3b-on-PBS.aspx',0,'post','',2),(144,2,'2007-10-08 05:18:00','2007-10-08 05:18:00','<p>\r\nFor the next three weeks, 20 university teams from across the country will be competing in Washington DC to &quot;design, build, and operate the most attractive and energy-efficient solar-powered house.&quot;&nbsp; The teams had to build their houses at their various schools and transport them to Washington for the competition - they are actually setting up on the National Mall for public visitation and review.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\nI was introduced to this project by my dad who is a Professor of Architecture at Lawrence Technological University (LTU) in Southfield, MI.

And go through the entire \"channel\" using the \"j\" and \"k\" keys to jump from one article to the next.&nbsp; When one is interesting I can read it in full or \"star\" if for later.&nbsp; Just like GMail, Reader allows you to add a star to any post. This is like bookmarking the post for later reading or research.&nbsp; Google Reader also lets me \"share\" any posts which creates a custom page (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader/shared/10475243398710149798\">http://www.google.com/reader/shared/10475243398710149798</a> ) and feed of the stuff I found interesting enough to read (and perhaps follow up on).&nbsp; If I think it is interesting to someone else, I can even e-mail it right from the reader to that person.</p> <p>So, out of the 9,564 items in the last 30 days, 50 were interesting enough to share, 21 were interesting enough to e-mail, and only 3-4 were interesting enough for me to really blog about.</p> <p><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px;

</p> <p>I know online video and webcasts have been available for a while in other formats.&nbsp; But this being on YouTube is a big deal just because so many people use YouTube and you can get their video just about anywhere (i.e. web, media center, iPhone, even download to iPod) - now wouldn\'t it be cool to have video Podcasts with the lectures and notes/handouts all together in one place (kind of like Make magazine does with their weekend projects).</p> <p>If you remember last year MIT was promoting their \"MIT Open Courseware\" initiative (<a title=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm\" href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm\">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm</a>) where they put hundreds of classes online.&nbsp;

I just noticed that Google changed their logo today on the main search page - cool.</p> <p>What struck me most about this is that 50 years is both a long time&nbsp;(10+ years before I was born) and a&nbsp;really short time (many people are alive today who remember this day in history&nbsp;- and&nbsp; remember&nbsp;a time when there was nothing in space (nothing) that man had put there).&nbsp; Now it seems almost routine to watch digital TV, radio, call overseas, use a GPS, and more.&nbsp; Space shuttle launches aren\'t \"front page news\" anymore and people are even planning for \"entertainment\" trips into space.&nbsp; A lot has changed.</p> <p>One thing I learned more about in reading these articles this morning was about Sputnik 2 - the one that would launch a month later on November 3, 1957.&nbsp; This one carried a dog named Laika who was sent up with food and air and became the first living creature to reach orbit.&nbsp; It is thought that she survived for 3-4 orbits (five to seven hours) though rumors at the time had her living for much longer.&nbsp; Sputnik 2 itself lasted in orbit for 163 days during which it traveled about 100 million kilometers.</p> <p>In the 50 years since Sputnik it seems like the most progress was in the first 10 years, though I know this is deceiving.&nbsp; We got people to the moon on July 20, 1969, right before I turned 1 year old.&nbsp; I wonder what will happen in the next 50 years.&nbsp; Will we get back to the moon? maybe China or Europe will?&nbsp;

First, I generally listen to music - at work, mowing the lawn, etc.).&nbsp; Also, if I were to watch a show or a movie I would to it on my TV which is much better suited for this purpose.&nbsp; I added a few YouTube videos (Numa Numa, Miss Teen USA 2007 - South Carolina) just for \"demo\" purposes.&nbsp; I am trying to see what it would take to hook it up to a TV - might be nice for taking videos of the children when we go to see the relatives.&nbsp; I guess if you had a long commute on a train, or had an hour between college classes, etc. that the video would be interesting.&nbsp;

They invited 6-12 graders who were interested in learning computer programming to come to the classes. These were green-screen terminals using a book from Radio Shack. We couldn’t save any work each session – typed it in every time, and were considered lucky a few times to work on the machine that could output to a green-bar dot-matrix printer. <p><a href=\"http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/mirror/ShowandTell2CommunityCollegeComputerCour_137F1/occ_certificate.jpg\" atomicselection=\"true\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"373\" alt=\"occ_certificate\" src=\"http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/mirror/ShowandTell2CommunityCollegeComputerCour_137F1/occ_certificate_thumb.jpg\" width=\"500\" border=\"0\"></a></p> <p>I wanted a computer really badly but they were very expensive ($1200 or so in 1979 money - which is probably close to $4000 now). My parents offered to let me take this course to see how well I fared. I ended up taking the exact same class twice just to get the computer time in the lab. My dad was (is) a professor at a local college and was able to bring home an Apple ][ computer over the summer. He got to learn VisiCalc, I got to program on my own time. When the Apple ][+ came out we were able to get it at about half price through the school. I was in the third year of my paper route which helped buy all the extras (e.g. cables, media, game controllers, etc.) <p>So what did I learn here? <ol> <li><strong>I really like to learn and discover things</strong> - solving puzzles and figuring out how things work.</li> <li><strong>People will misspell my name for the rest of my life</strong> - A B E R N <em><strong><u>E</u></strong></em> T H Y (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abernethy\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>&nbsp;if you don\'t believe me - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nethy_Bridge\" target=\"_blank\">several times</a>).&nbsp;

In moving back in, we decided that the only stuff that could come back into the house was that which fit, and had a place.&nbsp; So through some significant selling (on Craigslist among other places), garage sales, and select trips to Good Will (and several full garbage containers) we are getting close.&nbsp; I recommend if you have been in a place for 5 years or more to perhaps go through this exercise even if you aren\'t moving (but we never would have if we weren\'t serious about moving).</p> <p>Anyway, I found some very interesting stuff in my boxes and containers that I chose to save but have little meaning to anyone but me, and they have stories associated with them that no one probably remembers but me.</p> <h3>So here is Exhibit #1 - \"Floppy Diskette, circa 1981\"</h3> <p><a href=\"http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/mirror/ShowandTell1LifesExperiments_12F69/lifes_experiments.jpg\" atomicselection=\"true\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px;

I have one 8\" and two 5 1/4\" disks remaining - I have no idea if they are even readable any more.&nbsp; This disk is labeled (if you look closely) \"Life\'s Experiments\".&nbsp; How ironic.&nbsp; I guess if you are 13 years old and have compiled 3-4 years worth of&nbsp;of AppleSoft BASIC programs onto one Single-Sided, Double-Density (SSDD) disk (off of cassette tapes and print outs (yes we did retype a lot when necessary)) then it seems like a monumental task.&nbsp; There were three apps in particular that were worth saving: <strong>\"The Lord of the Rings Adventure\"</strong> (text-based, based on the books, very limited parser), <strong>\"Gurder\"</strong> a high-resolution graphics program based on a popular game at the time involving a plumber and a big monkey (never did get the collision detection working), and<strong> \"The Billings Murders\"</strong> an mystery adventure&nbsp;program written in Apple Pascal which I worked on for countless&nbsp;hours with Andy over gallons of Mountain Dew - the app&nbsp;included cutting edge sound effects with the MockingBoard (foot steps, creaking doors) and an updated version of the LOTR-A parser :-) .</p> <p>In looking at much of this stuff I am trying to figure out (1) what did I learn academically&nbsp;from all of this (maybe some wisdom can come of it) and (2) what did I learn about me.</p> <p>Six things come to mind:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Backup your code</strong> - lesson never gets old.&nbsp; I actually have copies of the \"critical apps\" on the other 5 1/4\" floppy</li> <li><strong>Always be a \"hacker\"</strong> - use things in ways they were not designed (in a good way).&nbsp; Noticed this is a \"Single Sided\" disk from the Kodak label, but also notice 2 (two) notches on either side of the disk (yes in the olden days these were used to \"write-protect\" the disks).&nbsp; It became common knowledge, through some computer magazines and trips to the \"Computer Connection\" store, that the only difference in \"modern floppies\" between single- and double-sided disks was the notch on the side.&nbsp; If you cut&nbsp;(first with scissors and later with a punch) a notch on the \"other\" side of a single-sided disc, you ended up with a double-sided disk (and waaaay cheaper).</li> <li><strong>Code every day</strong> - even something small, learn something new</li> <li><strong>Know \"how\" things work</strong>&nbsp;- modern computer users seem like they are&nbsp;treated&nbsp;as if they are much less intelligent than 20 years ago.&nbsp; Just look at the warning no the back (cropped) of the disk.&nbsp; \"Keep&nbsp;away from magnetic fields.\"?&nbsp;Store&nbsp;\"within the&nbsp;system operating environment\" with specific&nbsp;Temperature and Relative Humidity.&nbsp; &nbsp;We\'ve become such a society of computer \"users\" that we really don\'t understand how things work - we\'re just happy that they do.&nbsp; I\'m glad things work \"out of the box\" nowadays, but would it really hurt people to have to format a disk (or even know/care what that means&nbsp;- or what a magnetic field even is for that matter)?</li> <li><strong>Learn a new programming&nbsp;language every&nbsp;year&nbsp;</strong>(or if you aren\'t a programmer&nbsp;use a new tool/idea)&nbsp;- even if you don\'t have to, pick something up that may be completely unrelated to what you are working on.&nbsp; I won\'t walk you through adventures in Modula2, PAL, Logo, HyperTalk, Objective C, Dylan/NewtonScript and LiveWire (not to mention the \"obvious\" languages) but even if you only use a language for a short time, you will learn from it.&nbsp;

You might not think the marshmallow will \"find the way\" through the two turns and \"t\"s but it does, and picks up some amazing speed along the way.&nbsp; One other change we made after the first one was to extend the length of the piece that connects the barrel to the mouthpiece, from 1\" to 2\".&nbsp; 1\" was just a little too short to always have enough PVC to have a nice connection between the two pieces.&nbsp; Oh and there is no PVC glue/cement involved - just the pieces stayed together well enough (and enabled you to put a stick down the barrel if a marshmallow got stuck (usually when someone tried to put 3-5 through at the same time - rapid fire).</p> <p>Accuracy is pretty good with the standard shooter - even better with a little longer barrel.</p> <p>Of course Uncle Kenny and Joey had to \"super charge\" their\'s by adding the compressor.&nbsp;

A game you play by yourself is really more of a “puzzle”, skill builder, or simulation. And while I have played games that use a single player, I lose interest very quickly when other “real people” are not involved. There is nothing wrong with “solitaire” style games, <em>Suduko</em> or word puzzles, or Rubik’s Cubes but I like multiplayer games where you are face-to-face. <p> So here we have 4 of 5 game \"tubs\" that I am now going through to figure out how to store and which ones to keep.&nbsp; If you look closely you will see classics like&nbsp; <em>Clue</em>, <em>Stratego</em>, <em>Axis &amp; Allies</em>, <em>Civilization</em>, <em>Risk</em>, and the like.</p> <p>You\'ll also see some \"European\" games like the <em>Settlers of Catan</em> (and variants), <em>Carcassonne</em>, <em>El Grande</em>, etc., also <em>Empire Builders</em>, <em>RoboRally</em> (the original), <em>Terrace</em> (from StarTrek TNG).&nbsp; And, obscure titles like <em>Cosmic Encounter, Kill Doctor Lucky, </em>and others.&nbsp; Yes there are \"normal games\" like <em>Monopoly</em>, <em>Scrabble</em>, Chess/Checkers, <em>Othello</em>, <em>Sequence</em>, etc. and card games (pretty much all of them, <em>Uno</em>, <em>Phase 10</em>, and <em>Split</em> being recent favorites) in our home, but I don\'t have to store those (except more obscure ones like <em>The Great Dalmutti</em>, <em>Once Upon a Time</em>, and <em>Guillotine</em>).&nbsp; And some newer games like <em>Wits &amp; Wagers</em> (think trivia mixed with Texas Hold\'em).</p> <p>Now I am not in nearly as bad a shape with games as I am with books, but I still probably have too many.&nbsp; If we played a different game each week, we could go over a year without repeating (and what is the fun of that (not repeating)).&nbsp; The problem with deciding which games to get rid of is what should the standard be?&nbsp; How long since you last played them?&nbsp; How hard they would be to get again should you \"need\" them?&nbsp; The cost of the game (some are cheap, some are not)?&nbsp; I did cut a good third of the games over the last few years so all the easy ones are taken care of.&nbsp; There is even one I wish I could get back.</p> <p>I think I just need to find a better way to store them, and maybe put a \"sticker\" on each box with today\'s date and remove it when we play the games, thus tracking which ones are really used and are worthy to store.</p> <p>Anyone else have a similar issue or solution?</p>','Collection/Addiction #2: Games','','publish','open','open','','collectionaddiction-2-games','','','2007-08-29 08:32:01','2007-08-29 08:32:01','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/CollectionAddiction-2-Games.aspx',0,'post','',1),(167,2,'2007-08-28 11:46:25','2007-08-28 11:46:25','<p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/WindowsLiveWriter/Ifyouhavetoworkinacube_9780/garden_cube.jpg\" atomicselection=\"true\"><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px;

My &ldquo;book problem&rdquo; started 30 years ago when I found that some books were really, really good &ndash; ones I wanted to read over again, or that impacted me in some way.&nbsp; Then I became a student &ndash; got more great books (you are required to buy books as a student).&nbsp; Then I became a teacher &ndash; collected and hoarded even more books with the &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll use them in my job&rdquo; excuse.&nbsp; Then I wrote a couple books for teachers and students using technology &ndash; need to do research and build up a library.&nbsp; Then I went to grad school and became a school district technology administrator &ndash; say no more.&nbsp; Then came Amazon.com in 1995 which really didn&rsquo;t help &ndash; and yes I was one of their first and best customers. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy wife has routinely tried to help me fight my habit, but then she went to school and became a teacher and developed her own habit (though it pales in comparison).&nbsp; You know you have a problem when you help all your friends move into their new place, and realize what a paltry collection of books they own &ndash; do these people read?&nbsp; People who are smarter and wiser than you have only a small fraction of the books have only a fraction of the books you have accumulated?&nbsp; Sure you can find an occasional addict who has more books (mostly cheap paperbacks), but you know something is amiss. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt&rsquo;s been 10 years now since I started cutting back &ndash; first making sure it was a &ldquo;zero-sum game&rdquo; - then trying to reduce.&nbsp; My books were never inventoried, though I know there were hundreds and hundreds (maybe more).&nbsp; In one summer I purged &gt;1/3 of them with relative ease and since have probably removed another 1/3 of the orignal stock.&nbsp; Used bookstores will only buy so many &ndash; and then want to give you &ldquo;trade credit&rdquo; (to keep you hooked), many were &quot;gifted&quot;, some people &quot;hit the jackpot&quot; at several garage sales, and our local library is now well stocked in education and technology titles (and mysteries, and fiction, inspirational books, science fiction, non-fiction, action, cooking, etc.) \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI went to the &ldquo;if I can easily get it from the local library it shouldn&rsquo;t be in my library&rdquo; rule (with limited &ldquo;veto&rdquo; authority).&nbsp; Then on to the &ldquo;if I can&rsquo;t see (and plan) to read or use this book in the foreseeable future it should not be in my library&rdquo; rule which has been even more helpful.&nbsp; I am down to my last 15-20 U-Haul book boxes and am getting close to the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; Though this is the really hard part.&nbsp; These are books that have &ldquo;survived&rdquo; many previous cullings and therefore have built-in excuses &ndash; ones I&rsquo;ve boxed up and physically moved several times without discarding them.&nbsp; \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne of my main problems here is three of the boxes are old &ldquo;Astounding/Analog&rdquo; magazines from the 1940s-50s with some of the classic &ldquo;pulp&rdquo; serials from people like E.E. &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Smith, Van Vogt, Heinlein, Asimov and del Rey.&nbsp; This is kind of a &ldquo;collection within a collection&rdquo; which breaks all my new rules for simplifying and reducing &ndash; but it is so hard to let go. It is classic sci-fi, and even history, all in one.&nbsp; So many of their ideas have become realities, many more have not. I am leaving these boxes for last, as these are not replaceable once I decide to give them up. I wonder when the magazines are out of copyright? Maybe they will show up in digital form. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy other problem is two full boxes of &quot;old books&quot; - mostly pre 1900 - mostly science or math related.&nbsp;&nbsp; These I have collected over the years and include science that has been disproven or become out-of-date (the &quot;ether&quot; between the planets, planets in the solar system, number of elements, nature of the atom, electricity and magnetism etc.).&nbsp; Much of the science and math hasn&#39;t changed - Newtonian Mechanics, Euclidean Geometry, etc.&nbsp; But old books, to me, are so cool - history and science.&nbsp; I have old maps that don&#39;t even have all the states, don&#39;t have Israel (just Palestine), and so many other changes through the last century.&nbsp; But, I haven&#39;t opened these books in many years (if at all for more than a few minutes), so why am I keeping them? \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat I have now is a defined book storage space where all my books need to fit.&nbsp; It includes a generous amount of space in a whole-wall entertainment center in the basement, one long shelf over my computer, and some limited space in the workshop/laundry room.&nbsp; But once this space is occupied the rest of the books need to go.&nbsp; I have about a month to complete the task, but fall comes quickly and gets busy fast.&nbsp; I may have a &ldquo;fire sale&rdquo; soon if you are interested &ndash; I&rsquo;ll post on it here. \r\n</p>\r\n','Remaining Collection/Addiction #1: Books','','publish','open','open','','remaining-collectionaddiction-1-books','','','2007-08-27 21:33:00','2007-08-27 21:33:00','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Remaining-CollectionAddiction-1-Books.aspx',0,'post','',3),(169,2,'2007-08-27 14:12:00','2007-08-27 14:12:00','<p>\r\nWe would decide to try to move during the most difficult real estate market in recent memory.&nbsp; It is depressing going to open houses just to find out the previous occupants have been evicted (or are in the process) &ndash; but the bank wants to make a quick deal, for a low, low price &hellip;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe&#39;ve been trying to move &quot;by owner&quot; for a while now, and have been considering going with a real estate professional.&nbsp; But when you do the math it just doesn&#39;t work out.&nbsp; We&#39;re told to expect 10-20% off the house&#39;s value in this market, but that&#39;s just the start - expect 7% real estate commission(s), closing costs, and then expect to add 2% to our existing mortgage rate for the next house.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo basically write off $50,000ish in equity off the top and add $300/month in increased interest payments - so get only a little more house for a whole lot more money.&nbsp; And, if we get into a 30-year fixed loan, I won&#39;t own the house until I&#39;m almost 70.&nbsp; \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOR, stay where you are, make the same payments you were planning for on the new house but on the current mortgage and own this house outright in &lt;5 years (which just so happens to be right about when the kids may decide to start going off to college (and/or driving)). \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nKind of a math &ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo; but it means we need to be able to fit in our nice little house and make it work for us.&nbsp; So we are in the middle of an effort to get rid of all the non-essentials (some selling off, some just throwing away (I&rsquo;ll never use those notes from college &ndash; what was I thinking?

Did you know that the brain only weights 2% of body mass but consumes over 20% of the&nbsp;oxygen and nutrients&nbsp;we intake? As a general rule, you don\'t need expensive ultra-sophisticated nutritional supplements, just make sure you don\'t stuff yourself&nbsp;with the \"bad stuff\".  <li>Remember that the brain is part of the body.&nbsp;Things that exercise your body&nbsp;can also help sharpen your brain: physical exercise enhances neurogenesis.  <li>Thrive&nbsp;on&nbsp;Learning&nbsp;and Mental Challenges. The point of having a brain is precisely to learn and to adapt to challenging new environments. Once new neurons appear in your brain, where they stay in your brain&nbsp;and how long they survive depends on how you use them. \"Use It or Lose It\" does not mean \"do crossword puzzle number 1,234,567\". It means, \"challenge&nbsp;your brain&nbsp;often with fundamentally new activities\".&nbsp;  <li>Don\'t Outsource Your Brain. Not to&nbsp;media personalities, not to politicians, not to your smart neighbour... Make your own decisions, and mistakes. And learn from them. That way, you are training your brain, not your neighbour\'s.  <li>Develop&nbsp;and maintain&nbsp;stimulating&nbsp;friendships.&nbsp;We are \"social animals\", and need social interaction. Which, by the way,&nbsp;is why \'Baby Einstein\'&nbsp;has been shown not to be the panacea for children development.  <li>Laugh.

But it is a legitimate article from 1999 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, by Justin Kruger and David Dunning of Cornell University – I’ll link to the <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/journals/features/psp7761121.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PDF of the article</a> as well (<a href=\"http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/mirror/unskilled.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">mirror - 498KB</a>). <p>The main points of the article that I am interested in, are the possible consequences for people who believe that their skills or knowledge are actually more advanced than they are in reality. Using the categories from the <a href=\"http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/post/The-Dreyfus-Model-of-Skills-Acquisition.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Dreyfus Model</a>, what is the impact of a person who is really a <b>Novice</b> in a particular skill believing that they are an <b>Expert</b>? <p>The authors state clearly that those that believe themselves to be at a higher skill level than they really are “suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it.” Further these people do not have the “skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error.” In general they found that people suffered the “Above-Average Effect” – that is, that people tend to believe that they are above-average in most all subjects among their peers. “Incompetent individuals … will be less able than their more competent peers to recognize competence when they see it”. <p>In other words until you learn more about a particular skill you (1) don’t know what you don’t know and (2) may believe you know much more than you actually do know. So your assessment of how much you know about a topic is actually inversely proportional to the amount that you do know. For example, the more you learn about Physics the more you realize how little you actually know – and understand how much more there is to learn. First you have a basic idea of the different chemical elements, then understand something about atoms, then learn about protons, neutrons and electrons, then learn that you can break even these up into quarks (and a mess of other stuff) then realize that mass and energy are basically the same thing at some level (let’s not even get into Quantum Mechanics and String Theory). What you initially thought was pretty simple and straightforward has become quite detailed and complex. Conversely, if you have only played a few games of Chess, and can make your moves very quickly, you may think that a Chess expert who takes a longer time to move is not as good at the game as you are. <p>In the study the only way found to help people with inflated self-assessments was “Paradoxically, improving the skills of the participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.” So once they learned more about the different topics they realized how little they actually knew to begin with. Hence the “I’ve been so stupid” or “I didn’t realize ….”. <p>In a thought-provoking conclusion to their study they make an analogy between ignorance in a particular topic and a neurological condition called anosognosia which is “Caused by certain types of damage to the right side of the brain. Anosognosia leaves people paralyzed on the left side of their body. But more than that, when doctors place a cup in front of such patients and ask them to pick it up with their left hand, patients not only fail to comply but also fail to understand why. When asked to explain their failure, such patients might state that they are tired, that they did not hear the doctor’s instructions, or that they did not feel like responding – but never that they are suffering from paralysis. In essence, anosognosia not only causes paralysis, but also the inability to realize that one is paralyzed.” <p>So what does this mean for kids learning about Physics, Space, and Technology? If they only really do learn enough to be a <strong>Novice</strong> or <strong>Advanced Beginner</strong>, and never become Competent, they could (1) think they really know an “above-average” amount about these important topics – i.e. even think they are an <strong>Expert</strong> just because they passed a test or got an “A” in a class, and (2) make bad decisions and not recognize important science and technology in their future. The only way to save kids from this is to enable them to experience and learn more about these important topics and become <strong>Competent</strong>. As a bonus they will also have an accurate assessment of what they know in these areas and be able to recognize important science and technology in their future (and save them from being fooled by bad science and technology fads). <p>More on this to come … <p>p.s. the<em> Dreyfus Model</em> and <em>Unskilled and Unaware</em> are also great tools for interviewing prospective employees and creating training or mentoring programs, but that is a whole other topic.</p>','Unskilled and Unaware of It','','publish','open','open','','unskilled-and-unaware-of-it','','','2007-08-18 09:30:51','2007-08-18 09:30:51','',0,'/BlogEngine.NET/post/Unskilled-and-Unaware-of-It.aspx',0,'post','',2),(177,2,'2007-08-18 07:29:00','2007-08-18 07:29:00','<p>\r\nOK, this post will be a little &ldquo;heady&rdquo; for a Saturday morning but I want to reference&nbsp;this topic&nbsp;for some other work I am&nbsp;going to do this fall.&nbsp;I am planning to do some non-trivial work to get some resources and links online to help kids get into doing projects and learning about things like physics, space science, and robotics/electronics &ndash; things if you know me, you know I&rsquo;ve been into for a long time. The problem with the way kids learn about these topics nowadays is that it is mostly abstract, in theories, reading, or just &ldquo;on paper.&rdquo; To really learn more than trivia and facts about these topics you really need to &ldquo;do&rdquo; things with the science, not just learn things &ldquo;about&rdquo; them. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are several articles or models from people that really affect the way I am going to approach things, and have impacted my thinking about the approach to learning things. I&rsquo;ll hit each of them separately and then pull them all together later as kind of an approach for what I am going to try. None of these articles or their ideas should really come as a surprise to anyone &ndash; they make sense when you read them. But the authors do a great job of describing things in a depth and detail that I never could. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe first article and model is the Dreyfus Model &ndash; which is based originally on a report by Hubert Dreyfus and Stuart Dreyfus in the early 80s called &ldquo;<em>A Five-Stage Model of the Mental Activities Involved in Directed Skill Acquisition</em>.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll try to link to the study itself which is in a <a href=\"http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA084551&amp;Location=U2&amp;<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/editors/tiny_mce3/themes/advanced/langs/en.js\"></script>doc=GetTRDoc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PDF file</a> (scanned in <a href=\"/mirror/dreyfusdoc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">mirror 783k</a>) &ndash; don&rsquo;t read it yet, just follow along here for a minute. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis study was prepared initially for the Air Force Office of Scientific Research for the training of pilots, but its model and purpose has been used effectively for training everyone from pilots, to nurses, to chess players, foreign language learners, and even computer programmers (Google &ldquo;Dreyfus Model&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=dreyfus+model\">http://www.google.com/search?q=dreyfus+model</a> and will see lots of different results of people using it (and some people arguing against it)). I like it, so I am going to use it. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo keep this to as few words as possible, Dreyfus identifies five to seven stages of learning a new skill or domain: \r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 25px; margin-left: 35px\">\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Novice, </li>\r\n	<li>Advanced Beginner, </li>\r\n	<li>Competent, </li>\r\n	<li>Proficient, </li>\r\n	<li>Expert, and </li>\r\n	<li>Master.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nI don&rsquo;t know about you but I find that many people use terms like &ldquo;Competent&rdquo; and &ldquo;Expert&rdquo; in describing their skills but really have no objective model for putting them in one category or another. Some people move themselves from not knowing anything about a particular skill up to &ldquo;Competent&rdquo; just by reading a book about the topic. Others call themselves an &ldquo;Expert&rdquo; after completing one project using a particular skill or technology. I am reminded of an episode of &ldquo;Monk&rdquo; where the detective Adrian Monk is going on a boat and someone asks him if he can swim. He says he knows how to swim, and even produces a card from his wallet certifying him as a swimmer (from a correspondence course), but also admits he has never actually been in the water to try out his skills but thinks he&rsquo;ll do fine. Some people are that way with technology and other domains where they have studied it in books and on the Internet but have never really &ldquo;done&rdquo; real-world things to use what they have learned. You learn by doing things, you don&rsquo;t (can&rsquo;t) really learn before you do something. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat this model does is two important things: (1) helps better define what these stages of learning mean and (2) explains a workable model for moving people from one stage to the next. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBriefly, the stages: \r\n</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Novice</strong></h2>\r\n<p>\r\nA novice is all about following <u>rules</u> &ndash; specific rules, without context or modification. You don&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;think&rdquo; you just need to &ldquo;do&rdquo;. A rule is absolute, and must never be violated. The main thing to do here is to get experience following directions and doing the new skill. You can follow the instructions on a box of cake mix and hopefully produce a decent cake. All you are responsible for is following directions. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;To improve, the novice needs monitoring, either by self-observation or instructional <u>feedback</u>, so as to bring his behavior more and more completely into conformity with the rule.&rdquo; \r\n</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Advanced Beginner</strong></h2>\r\n<p>\r\nStill rules based, but rules start to have situational conditions. In one situation you use one rule, in other situations you use another. The advanced beginner needs to be able to identify the limited need to selectively apply different rules. So if you want a chocolate cake, follow the chocolate rule(s), if you want a vanilla cake, follow the other rule(s). If you are over 5,000ft of altitude you will need to alter the amount of some ingredients. This is still a recipe, but has a few decision points. Again, follow the different &ldquo;branches&rdquo; of instructions and you should be fine. It is easy to see how this could collapse into a large Novice category, but it is a step before the much larger step to Competence. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Competent</strong></h2>\r\n<p>\r\nYou realize that your skill or domain is more complex than a series of rules and branches. You start to see patterns and principles (or <u>aspects</u>) rather than a discrete set of rules &ndash; rules become &ldquo;rules of thumb&rdquo;. You are lead more by your experience and active decision-making than by strictly following rules. What is developed now are <u>guidelines</u> that help direct competent individuals at a higher level. You now are accountable for your decisions as you are not following the strict rules and context of the previous stages. You&rsquo;ve made a lot of cakes and have a number of recipes. When asked to make a cake of a different type you pull from experience the best way to put a new cake together. If the new cake doesn&rsquo;t work out, you are responsible. This is the critical tipping point for most people when learning a new skill &ndash; and why most people never really become &ldquo;competent&rdquo; in most things they learn. Here you either need to decide to just &ldquo;follow the rules&rdquo; or spend the time to get fully involved with and take responsibility. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Competence comes only after <u>considerable experience</u> actually coping <u>with real situations</u> &hellip;&rdquo; \r\n</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Proficient</strong></h2>At this point your understanding of your skill or domain has become more of an <u>instinct</u> or <u>intuition</u>. You will do and try things because it just seems like the right thing to do (and you will most often be right). Instead of a discrete set of different parts you can perceive a complete system. A large amount of real-world experience will show you that there are often multiple competing solutions to a specific problem and you have a &ldquo;gut feeling&rdquo; about which is correct. &ldquo;Calculation and rational analysis seem to disappear&rdquo;. Will quickly know &ldquo;what&rdquo; needs to be done and then formulate how to do it. \r\n<p>\r\nProficiency is developed by exposure to a &ldquo;<u>wide variety</u> of typical <u>whole situations</u>.&rdquo; \r\n</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Expert</strong> </h2>\r\n<p>\r\nAt this point you are not solving problems or making conscious decisions about things, you just &ldquo;do&rdquo; and it works. &ldquo;Optimal performance becomes second nature.&rdquo; People may ask you why you decided to do things &ldquo;that way&rdquo; and you may not know how to explain to them the 10 steps necessary to get from &ldquo;A&rdquo; to &ldquo;B&rdquo; because to you it was really just one step. Forcing an expert to detail the steps necessary before proceeding will often cause them to fail or second-guess. Here you think of grandma getting up at 6:00am and making biscuits from scratch for many, many years. She doesn&rsquo;t measure, time, or probably even think about baking &ndash; she just does it, and it works. Very few people will attain this level in a particular skill or domain. Some estimates say 10-15 years in a particular area is required. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAn Expert has experience that &ldquo;is so vast that normally each specific situation immediately dictates an <u>intuitively appropriate action</u>.&rdquo; \r\n</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Master</strong> </h2>\r\n<p>\r\nMastery is mostly about style. A Master of something is really just an &ldquo;Expert on a roll.&rdquo; Sometimes you may have witnessed someone or spent time with someone who is so good at something, and gets so caught up in doing it, that you can&rsquo;t help but feel that you are watching a genius at work. I&rsquo;d also say a Master is an Expert who can look back and put themselves in a Novice&rsquo;s shoes and create the rules, and do the monitoring/mentoring necessary to help them move forward. If you have met a Master you remember them &ndash; by name &ndash; they are rare and you would do well to spend as much time with them as possible. An Expert basketball player could be excellent at execution and without formal thought just picture the ball going through the hoop (and it does). But Michael Jordan could do it with such style, grace and physics-defying ease that you just had to stop everything and watch him when he was &ldquo;in the groove.&rdquo; \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA Master &ldquo;is capable of experiencing moments of intense absorption in his work, during which his performance transcends even its usual high level.&rdquo; \r\n</p>\r\n<h2><strong>The Point</strong> </h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you&rsquo;ve read this far, thanks, and I&rsquo;ll get to the point (1,000+ words later) &ndash; I believe that too many people today are learning just enough to be considered an &ldquo;Advanced Beginner&rdquo; in the vast majority of topics. Painfully this is increasingly true in science, math and technology. If you know enough to &ldquo;pass the test&rdquo; then that is all you need to know. The <em>No Child Left Behind </em>law was designed to keep people accountable for learning. But instead of having students be able to become Competent or even Proficient in a handful of skills, we have instead created a system where we have students stuck at &ldquo;Advanced Beginner&rdquo; in many more subjects &ndash; and perhaps unable to move forward. We are teaching kids that it is enough to know &ldquo;about&rdquo; things, but not actually &ldquo;do&rdquo; things. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo what can we do about it? We need to catalog and create a list of resources that will help kids get from Novice to Competent in science, math, and technology - things that will get them active in doing projects and making the connections necessary to move ahead. A lofty goal, but attainable. Many people are seeing similar voids and doing things about it. Linking and teaming with them will be key in our success. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMore on this to come &hellip;.. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBruce \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\np.s.

21:42:27','2011-07-06 01:42:27','It is no secret that most of my friends and family are non-programmers.  When a group of us get together “in real life” and I do find someone to talk technology with, we usually get the look of “oh they’ve gone off into the fantasy world of acronyms again, give them some space.”  I even slipped with my kids this weekend and mentioned something like “oooh, this week Visual Studio 2010 and Silverlight 4 come out!!”, and they politely asked what that was and why I was acting something like a kid at Christmas. So here is the short answer.\n\nEvery so often, programmers get an update of either their programming language, or their programming tools, or in this case BOTH.  While programming can be quite technical, it is still largely a creative process.  When writing new code you are creating something that did not exist before.  Usually you are creating this new thing for a customer or a group of people who need it or want it to improve their business or organization.  Software people sometimes use roles and titles from other crafts to describe what they do; some of us are “architects” or “engineers”.  When working with Silverlight we use all kinds of terms from artists like Canvas, Pens, Brushes, Strokes, etc.\n\nSo imagine you were in another creative craft such as painting.  And every so often you not only got a fresh set of brushes, but you also got some new brushes that you never had before, that enabled new strokes and techniques on your new canvases.  And a little less often you actually get new paints and even new colors that you never had before.  When the perfect storm happens and you get new tools, canvases, paint, colors, and more, this is a very exciting time.  This is a bit dramatic, but close to how I feel, especially when I am involved with a new project that actually needs some of these new tools and colors for what we are trying to do.\n<h3>What are some of the new “tools and colors” in VS2010?</h3>\nWell two big things are the ability to develop custom applications for both Windows 7 and Windows Phone 7 – Windows 7 has been out for a while and now programmers can take full advantage of a lot of the new features of Windows 7.  Windows Phone 7 will be out this fall and it basically a re-launch of the mobile phone platform for Microsoft.  No one knows how well Windows Phone 7 will compete with the iPhone and the Android phones, but the new features are very compelling and it should be fun to see what we can build for the new phones.\n\n<img style=\"margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline; border: 0px;\" title=\"silverlight-logo\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/silverlight-logo.jpg\" alt=\"silverlight-logo\" width=\"123\" height=\"123\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" /> But the main thing that I’ve been looking forward to is Silverlight 4 and its integration with VS2010. Developing in Silverlight with Visual Studio 2008 has been possible and productive, but going along with the painting analogy here, it has kind of been like “fingerpainting” compared to other kinds of development.  Now in VS2010, there is a full designer built in so you can preview and edit how Silverlight applications look and function right in the tool – this is nice.  It is also now much easier to change the style of an entire application so all the text, graphics, data input, etc. all look and work the same.  A big thing for me is enhancements to how animations and digital video can be streamed and manipulated in Silverlight.  Far beyond a simple video player with “VCR” controls, we can now do things with video that could never be done before. There are a ton more new features and possibilities coming out, but you get the picture.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, by Wednesday I will be actively using a bunch of new tools, brushes, and colors that I don’t have today (for production use) and be able to release applications that anyone on the Internet can use, which is why I am a little excited right now.','Why I make a fuss over the release of

When a group of us get together “in real life” and I do find someone to talk technology with, we usually get the look of “oh they’ve gone off into the fantasy world of acronyms again, give them some space.”&#160; I even slipped with my kids this weekend and mentioned something like “oooh, this week Visual Studio 2010 and Silverlight 4 come out!!”, and they politely asked what that was and why I was acting something like a kid at Christmas. So here is the short answer.</p>  <p>Every so often, programmers get an update of either their programming language, or their programming tools, or in this case BOTH.&#160; While programming can be quite technical, it is still largely a creative process.&#160; When writing new code you are creating something that did not exist before.&#160; Usually you are creating this new thing for a customer or a group of people who need it or want it to improve their business or organization.&#160; Software people sometimes use roles and titles from other crafts to describe what they do; some of us are “architects” or “engineers”.&#160; When working with Silverlight we use all kinds of terms from artists like Canvas, Pens, Brushes, Strokes, etc.</p>  <p>So imagine you were in another creative craft such as painting.&#160; And every so often you not only got a fresh set of brushes, but you also got some new brushes that you never had before, that enabled new strokes and techniques on your new canvases.&#160; And a little less often you actually get new paints and even new colors that you never had before.&#160; When the perfect storm happens and you get new tools, canvases, paint, colors, and more, this is a very exciting time.&#160; This is a bit dramatic, but close to how I feel, especially when I am involved with a new project that actually needs some of these new tools and colors for what we are trying to do.</p>  <h3>What are some of the new “tools and colors” in VS2010?</h3>  <p>Well two big things are the ability to develop custom applications for both Windows 7 and Windows Phone 7 – Windows 7 has been out for a while and now programmers can take full advantage of a lot of the new features of Windows 7.&#160; Windows Phone 7 will be out this fall and it basically a re-launch of the mobile phone platform for Microsoft.&#160; No one knows how well Windows Phone 7 will compete with the iPhone and the Android phones, but the new features are very compelling and it should be fun to see what we can build for the new phones.</p>  <p><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"silverlight-logo\" border=\"0\" alt=\"silverlight-logo\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/silverlight-logo.jpg\" width=\"123\" height=\"123\" /> But the main thing that I’ve been looking forward to is Silverlight 4 and its integration with VS2010. Developing in Silverlight with Visual Studio 2008 has been possible and productive, but going along with the painting analogy here, it has kind of been like “fingerpainting” compared to other kinds of development.&#160; Now in VS2010, there is a full designer built in so you can preview and edit how Silverlight applications look and function right in the tool – this is nice.&#160; It is also now much easier to change the style of an entire application so all the text, graphics, data input, etc. all look and work the same.&#160; A big thing for me is enhancements to how animations and digital video can be streamed and manipulated in Silverlight.&#160; Far beyond a simple video player with “VCR” controls, we can now do things with video that could never be done before. There are a ton more new features and possibilities coming out, but you get the picture.</p>  <p>So, in a nutshell, by Wednesday I will be actively using a bunch of new tools, brushes, and colors that I don’t have today (for production use) and be able to release applications that anyone on the Internet can use, which is why I am a little excited right now.</p>','Why I make a fuss over the release

blog up and running again by the end of June – so I figured I’d get a head start today <img class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile\" style=\"border-style: none;\" src=\"http://www.agileeducation.net/myblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/wlEmoticon-smile.png\" alt=\"Smile\" />\r\n\r\nI’ve been away from blogging for a while – first because of a major technical snafu at my previous hosting provider (WebHost4Life – ironic name), but then because of my lack of time and focus regarding blog posts.  Recently there has been so much going on and nowhere to blog, so I decided to start blogging again.\r\n\r\nI’ve opted for WordPress this time mainly for two reasons: 1) the previously mentioned “time factor” – WordPress is a two-click install and will automatically update itself when new versions come out (as 3.1.4 did today to handle some security issues), and 2) there are a bunch of really powerful (and mostly free) plugins and themes than those available in the BlogEngine.NET community.  I still operate a few BlogEngine.NET blogs for groups and clients, and where tighter control and easy customization is needed I’ll still go to BlogEngine for that (they have a shiny new version too).  But for my personal blog I am going with WordPress so I can (hopefully) focus more on the content and less on keeping things up to date and up and running.\r\n\r\n<strong>UPDATE:</strong>\r\n\r\nThe migration is going well – first major hurdles are taken care of.\r\n\r\nI have really liked Windows Live Writer as a blogging platform so I wanted to try to continue using that with WordPress.  Got that set up and posted some initial posts for testing – worked well.\r\n\r\nFound a helpful resource here: <a

0px\" title=\"Toastmasters\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Toastmasters\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/Toastmasters_thumb.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"216\" /></a>About a month ago I started attending a new group forming now in Grand Rapids called “ <a href=\"http://tmfortechies.freetoasthost.org/\">Toastmasters for Techies</a>”.&#160; I had heard of “Toastmasters” many times in the past as a group that had been around for a long long time to help people get better at speaking in public.&#160; Today in 2010, Toastmasters has served over four million people and is growing all the time – case in point being this “Toastmasters for Techies” group.</p>  <p>What drew me to this group was that is was: </p>  <ol>   <li>just getting started (didn’t want to be “behind”)</li>    <li>“unbranded” (some groups are part of businesses or organizations that I am not a part of)</li>    <li>local / close (meets downtown at Wealthy/Diamond at <a href=\"http://www.atomicobject.com/pages/Find+Us\">Atomic Object</a>)</li>    <li>focused on techies (not just “nerds” getting together and giving speeches, but better yet “geeks” getting together and giving speeches)</li>    <li>and I knew a few of the people who were already going and knew they were good people</li> </ol>  <p>If you know me you know I like to talk – probably too much, and probably too often.&#160; I gave professional presentations seven times last year, and five times each of the previous two years.&#160; I’ve also led a Robotics club with a bunch of kids and parents, been a Den Leader in Cub Scouts, taught classes at church, and spend quite a bit of time at work talking/discussing/debating ideas and projects with clients and team members.&#160; And all of this just means I am really part of the problem that Toastmasters is trying to solve.</p>  <p>If we are being honest right now, there are a lot of just-plain-bad-presentations out there in the computer field.&#160; Either a presenter is just too smart for the audience and loses them in the first five minutes, or they get caught up in a failed demo that was the basis of their entire session, or they are a good speaker but it is clear that “someone else” prepared the slides and the demos for them, or some unfortunate combination of these which we won’t talk about. I have even seen some speakers that seem to be just speaking for themselves and do not seem to be aware or care that there are any other people in the room.&#160; I am not alone in these observations.</p>  <p>Also, I’ll stop short of saying that “PowerPoint is Evil!” but I will say that it is a tool that has been used much more often as a crutch for bad speech preparation, or as a smoke screen for a clear lack of content, than to support presentations of substance.&#160; Even people that have gotten the whole “<a href=\"http://www.presentationzen.com/\">Presentation Zen</a>” idea seem to work harder on trying to find the right catchy picture for their content (or worse yet, catchy content for a cool picture they found).</p>  <p>Even if you have had similar experiences with such presentations, I need to say that the audience is also somewhat at fault.&#160; I have reviewed many evaluation forms from people at the events we have held or my own talks. The feedback always seems to be quite minimal and almost always “4-5 stars.”&#160; I don’t know if this is because most of the talks are free or given by volunteers, or if the bar has been set fairly low.&#160; There is an occasional “gem” of an evaluation, with some constructive criticism or suggestions for additions/improvement, and those are really “gold” to someone who takes their speaking seriously. One of the biggest things I have learned in my first month in Toastmasters is really how to evaluate and give feedback to speakers that they can use and work with.</p>  <p>I’ll be the first to stand up and testify that I need help being a better speaker.&#160; I have always gone over on time in my recent presentations – or at least cut out content that I had “intended” to get to.&#160; I always thought it was better to have a lot of content that covered a variety of areas.&#160; I have used and abused PowerPoint.&#160; Because I try to squeeze an over-abundance of content into talks I tend to talk very quickly, which can be entertaining and engaging, but is not optimal for learning.&#160; I admit I have sometimes finished or “tweaked” demos for a talk while setting up in the very room for the talk – again, keeps things “current” and “exciting” but doesn’t always show a concern for the content or audience.&#160; I want to improve.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/ti_logo1.jpg\"><img style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right:

this Toastmasters experience with the intent to become more precise and concise in my speaking.&#160; When I was first writing a monthly column I would write 1,200 or even 1,400 word articles only to have my ever-patient editor send them back and say to cut them down to 400-600 words but still “tell the same story.”&#160;&#160; Over the years I got better at writing within the boundaries of a print publication and even avoided many edits in my last few years of writing.&#160; I need to do the same thing with speaking – say less words but tell the same story.</p>  <p>Each Toastmasters Club needs to recruit 20 members to be formally established, and the group is almost half way there.&#160; I hope if you are a local “techie” that you are interested in improving your speaking skills, that you would consider stopping by on Monday over lunch as an “honored guest” at one of our meetings.</p>  <p>Feel free to check out our <a href=\"http://tmfortechies.freetoasthost.org/\">web site</a> or

11:22:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','There have been several good conversations (in person and on Twitter) about the impact of Steve Jobs on changing the way we think about the phone with the iPhone. The forward-thinking part of the article goes to \"what would Steve Jobs do\" in the years going forward in the area of the phone.  My opinions about this are here (note: this is intended to focus primarily on the \"phone\" part of the phone - that is the mostly audio synchronous conversation between two (or more) people):\n\nFuture innovations needed for the phone:\n\n1) <strong>Battery</strong> - this is true for all mobile devices.  Battery tech needs to last 10 times longer than it does right now.  In reality batteries last a day or two for a phone or tablet - this needs to be a week or more (a month?) to really be natural and unobtrusive.\n\n2) <strong>Shrink the \"phone\" part of the phone</strong> - think of your favorite action or sci-fi movie/show where people can talk to each other through an \"ear piece\" that is so small that it isn\'t visible.  Think of the small \"monitors\" that most on-stage musicians have now that fit snugly in their ear so they can move about and still get the critical feedback for their musical performance.  Why not have this as an option for everyone?  My daughter has had several molds made for her hearing aides over the years, and while there is a manual/labor process in getting a good and comfortable mold made, it is worth it.  I\'m sure with all the advances in cochlear implants (or similar devices) recently someone will want to create a phone-implant to get rid of the device entirely - I\'m really not ready to go there,if only because of Moore\'s Law and the speed that this technology is changing\n\n3) <strong>Get rid of \"phone numbers\"</strong> - we don\'t think of peoples IP number when we send them an e-mail or chat, we just have a \"name resolver\" that finds the web site or the e-mail host - do the same thing with people on their phones.  You could still have user identities that separate \"personal\" and \"work\" channels, but phone numbers are really out of date.\n\n4) <strong>Calling vs. talking.</strong>  The technology of the cell phone still seems to be in the mode where one person makes an explicit \"call\" to another person - and for many this will stick.  It\'d be cool if there were the ability (one the in-ear tech was worked out) that you could be able to \"enter and leave\" a conversation at-will throughout the day (more like \"instant messaging\" than \"calling\").  In this way you\'d be more having a conversation with another person on a regular basis rather than individual calls.\n\n5) <strong>Groups/Security for Incoming \"Calls\"</strong> - It\'d be nice to be able to be able to group the people who you\'d approve for communications at all times, during times when you are \"available\" for calls, and others that\'d go directly to voice-mail (e.g. unknown calls).  This would be especially important for the \"always-on\" aspect of voice conversations.\n\n6) <strong>Multi-person conversations.</strong>  Phone tech also seems to be stuck in the \"dyad\" idea that, in general, two people are involved in a phone call/conversation.  This again is a legacy concept for when their was basically a switched connection where one phone line was physically connected to another phone line.  It is possible to do \"three-way calling\" or even \"conference calling\" but these services are more the exception than the norm.  It needs to be easier to have a whole bunch of people in the same conversation - again, akin to the \"instant messaging in a group\").\n\n7) <strong>User interface / Screen</strong>. I\'ve consciously avoided the idea of what the \"screen\" on the phone should look like, or even how it integrates with the phone itself.  Should you have a device with a touch screen, high-definition camera, gyroscope/accelerometer, GPS, antenna, local storage, etc. paired up with your \"phone\".  It\'d be cool if this were an option, but not required.  You\'d need something to configure the features above.  And there is a reason to have a \"mobile apps\" device that you could have in addition to your \"phone\".  But to unnecessarily couple the \"apps platform\" to the \"phone platform\" will reduce innovations in both.\n\n&nbsp;','Future Phone Features','','draft','open','open','','','','','2011-10-10 11:22:00','2011-10-10 15:22:00','',0,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/?p=378',0,'post','',0),(359,2,'2011-08-11 23:23:28','2011-08-12 03:23:28','“Quit Bowling” and “Start Digging Ditches” – two memorable quotes from the first day of the Willow Creek Leadership Summit (Seth Godin and Steven Furtick respectively).  My mind is still processing and thinking through all that was presented today in the presentations and discussions with other attendees.   The conference reminds me a lot of TEDx GR from this summer – a number of great presentations from top speakers with wonderful conversations in between – but this time focused on a narrower theme of all things leadership.\r\n\r\nBill Hybels kicked off the day with five big questions and four helpful group exercises to work with leaders of any organization.  How do you determine if your leaders are under challenged, dangerously over challenged (DOC) or appropriately challenged?  Or even better how can you help your leaders reach that optimum level where they can operate at peak efficiency.  How do you deal with challenging people?  Are you evaluating, facing and resolving the problems facing your organization?  Do you routinely re-evaluate the core purpose of your organization?  Finally, Bill observed that all leaders need to get their “bell rung” by having situations that force them to ask the hard questions and get out of their comfort zones.\r\n\r\nNext we were presented with perhaps the best and most authentic and realistic discussion of modern entrepreneurship I have ever heard, from Len Schlesinger.  So many presentations of the ideas of entrepreneurship present it as requiring determined people with high-risk new ideas, usually in the technology arena, and needing a great deal of venture capital. In reality, most entrepreneurs prefer low-risk, not necessarily original ideas which typically see something that exists already and find a way to do it better.  Similar myths about new ideas and inventions are that they are based on research and predictions about the future based on the past.  In reality the future is always a non-linear extrapolation of what has come before.  You can’t predict the future – but you can create it.  Because of this “Action Trumps Everything” (which just happens to be the title of Schlesinger’s new book.  But sometimes frequent action leads to failure, but Len noted that if you are working on new ideas “by failing you probably learn what nobody else knows”.  Facing new efforts with the idea of “affordable loss” and taking “smart small steps” with regular action leads to success over time with new efforts.\r\n\r\nI wouldn’t want to follow that presentation, but next up was a man that spoke with passion, ideas, compassion and intelligence that I have not heard from a politician in a long time – I don’t even know Cory Booker’s political party but I would vote for him for office in a minute (and be very tempted to campaign for him).  Booker is the mayor of Newark, New Jersey (who’s life and story were detailed in the movie “Street Fight”).  His inspirational stories of his life and experiences in one of the most challenged (and oldest) cities in the country covered a range of issues and ideas on topics ranging from housing, to violence, to finding the best in every person.  He struggles with many peoples’ willingness to settle for average, status quo, and things being done the way they always have been done before.  He talked about “televisionism” and quipped about the various reality TV shows that have taken up residence in New Jersey.  He challenged all of us, with all our different organizations, to not settle but rather “do something”.\r\n\r\nAfter being challenged about several “comfort zones” of leadership and ideas, Brenda Salter McNeil kicked off the afternoon with some inspiring and wise words about bridging cultural divisions in our community, country and world.  She walked us through the modern-day implications of Acts 1:8 and how we need to build community with those closest to us, those near us but with some differing views, and also those who are as different from us as possible.  She also observed that we often need catalytic events to help us to mobilize people to go and do what is necessary.\r\n\r\nWith all the different topics today, it was easy to feel like we were “channel flipping” – except the quality of the presentations were so much higher than what is available on television.  Case in point was who came next, Seth Godin.  I have read several of Seth’s books and am familiar with a lot of his ideas.  He took us through a similar theme of average efforts leading to even more average products.  He reviewed his work how modern “tribes” turning social structures upside down and the laptop being the new means of production in the information and social age.  Seth also reinforced the idea of failure as an important option and possible outcome, noting specifically that “if failure is not an option than neither is success”.  His most striking illustration is that people need to “Stop Bowling” – meaning that, the whole point of bowling is in doing a repetitive task, over and over, and just trying to do it a little better the next time.  He compared this to competition in the bottled water industry, “What are they going to do, make the water wetter?”  Do great new things, “Don’t wait to get picked – Picked Yourself!”\r\n\r\nTo cap off the day we had a challenge to not only come to the conference for ideas and inspiration, but also to turn ideas into action.  Steven Furtick is a young, energetic and gifted speaker with a contagious passion to have faith in the big things that can be accomplished by faithful people.  He took us through a modern retelling of 2 Kings 3 where the armies of Israel and Judah found themselves desperate for water.  Through the words and actions of a spirited Elisha, they found that they needed to “make the valley full of ditches” (NIV) and that God would supply the water that they so desperately needed.  We can act in many different ways, in faith, but “Only God can bring the rain.”\r\n\r\nI am looking forward to another day at the conference tomorrow, and the days afterwards as I take what I’ve learned there and found ways to put it into practice – but for now, some sleep.','Quit Bowling, and Start

href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nooktouch.jpg\">\r\n</a>For Father’s Day this year I got a new Nook “Simple Touch Reader” so I have had it for about a month – time for a review.  I figure it was time when the “battery warning” came on yesterday and it told me I was down to 20% of capacity, so I decided to charge it up.  Going for a little over a month on the original 9 hour charge is one of the best aspects of this device.\r\n\r\nGetting right to the point, I am very happy with the overall performance and features of the Nook – the size, screen, user experience, format, battery life, price and storage capacity create a great package for casual and serious reading.\r\n<h2>Books on my Nook</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/cooking-for-geeks.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-246\" title=\"cooking-for-geeks\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/cooking-for-geeks-260x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"156\" height=\"180\" /></a>In the month I have had the Nook, I have read several complete books on the device.  A typical “Nook day” for me will start at 7:00am with some devotions and current events with the family (more on the news feeds and features a little later).  Our summer “book club” has taken us through <em><strong>Penrod</strong></em> by Booth Tarkington, and now mid-way through <em><strong>The Princess and the Goblin</strong></em> by George MacDonald.  After hearing a lot of chatter online, I “checked out” <em><strong>A Game of Thrones</strong></em> by George R.R Martin from the Kent District Library (KDL) / Midwest Collaborative for Library Services (MCLS).  I also got <em><strong>How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming</strong></em> by Mike Brown, and <em><strong>SEAL Team Six</strong></em> by Howard E. Wasdin, mainly because I liked the titles, but also because I was curious about more background of recent events.  I added some PDF study guides made from Word files for some Microsoft certification tests I am studying for as well (more on the lackluster PDF support of the Nook below as well). I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\r\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\r\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features.  Now with the new Nook I am going to try it out and see how well it works for me - can it replace print books for the majority of the reading that I do?\r\n<h4>Size</h4>\r\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\r\n<h4>Screen</h4>\r\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color. But now I am sold.  The black and white contrast ratios (“distance” from black to white) on my old Apple Newton or Palm Pilot (which I brought out for comparison) are about what you’d find on some old dot-matrix printer on newsprint.  These new “Pearl E Ink” displays are much more like a laser printer on nice white bond paper – as good, or better than most paperbacks and close to some hardcovers. I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\r\nBy getting rid of the keyboard and bottom button bar on the previous Kindle and Nook and going with a touch screen, the new Nook has maximized the screen for reading and created a very effective user interface. The applications that come with the Nook to help to buy books and read them have big \"touchable buttons\" and work well with the screen.  You can turn a page by swiping/touching on the side of the page that you want to turn.  Touching in the middle of the screen brings up an option bar at the bottom for more tools\r\n\r\nThere are six smartly-placed physical buttons on the unit: the on/off button which is on the rear of the unit in the upper middle (no real risk of shutting things off unintentionally - in fact I don\'t remember ever turning it off as it sleeps on its own), the \"Nook\" button in the bottom middle which brings up the main option bar at the bottom that allows you to go to the top-level pages, and four page turning buttons which aren\'t as obvious on first look, but are my favorite and I use them constantly.  The four buttons are in two pairs on either side of the unit.  There is a slight ridge line for each button - one from the middle of the unit up and the other from the middle of the unit down.  These are for page turning and are configurable (i.e. top goes to next page or to bottom page - your choice).  For longer reading sessions it is nice to have these buttons there so you can hold the book in one hand and just \"squeeze\" a bit to turn the page.  There is an inaudible \"click\" but one that you feel to know that the button has been pressed - just enough to know you did it right and keep from accidentally pushing it, but not enough to be annoying.  I know some people turn pages with the touch screen, but I am all about the side buttons - very nice.\r\n\r\n<strong>Format</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo3.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-260\" title=\"epub-logo\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"135\" /></a>I wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there - all but the Kindle which uses primarily the \"mobi\" book format.  So, while the Kindle has many/most of the free eBooks available now in the \"mobi\" format, and some libraries have started carrying some books for the Kindle, the ePub format is still the most widely supported.  This gap is closing quickly, but it is something that has been really useful to me so far.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that is attractive about the ePub format is that it has some nice computer programming APIs available for it.  All that means for me is that I can easily create ePub documents by writing computer software, which opens a world of opportunity going forward.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.techrepublic.com/photos/cracking-open-the-2011-barnes-noble-nook-e-book-reader-wi-fi/6243892?seq=15&amp;tag=thumbnail-view-selector;get-photo-roto\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-251\" title=\"nookbattery\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nookbattery-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>The claim from Barnes &amp; Noble was that you could get up to two months of battery life with the new Nook.  I did the initial charge of the Nook with the charger to the wall, and it was only after about a month that it started complaining that it wanted a recharge at 20% capacity.  I have, however, plugged the Nook on to the USB cable to load books and news feeds and I know that it does charge while connected, so I am sure it got some non-trivial electrons that way.  I have also left the WiFi radio on continuously since I got the device so I know that drains the battery as well.  My gut feel is that 2 months would really be a stretch, but that 3-4 weeks may be the reality – which is really a huge improvement over tablet and phone type devices.\r\n\r\nMy one beef about the battery is that it has followed the Apple model of being not easily end-user maintainable.  All batteries lose power and capacity over time so it\'d be nice to be able to change the battery fairly easily.  There are kits available online for $15-30 with videos and the tools necessary to complete the \"operation\" - but it can be uncomfortable for end-users to have to \"crack\" the case, remove ribbon cables, and see circuit boards/screen in order to change the battery.\r\n<h4>Memory / Expansion</h4>\r\nThe Nook comes with 2 Gb of internal storage, which (ironically) doesn\'t sound like much, until you realize that the average ePub book is about 200-400kb so that is thousands of books on the device.  But, just in case there are new and different things to do with the Nook that are an order of magnitude bigger than current eBooks, the Nook also has a mini-SD slot that will take up to 32Gb of additional storage.  This is more books than you have ever read, and ever will read.  The base memory is nice, and the user-enabled expansion is overkill.\r\n<h4>Price</h4>\r\nThe base price of the new reader came out at $139, which had the nice side-effect of sending the smaller Kindle down to this price point as well.  They are still probably marking up this device 50%-75% from the production cost.  I know \"value\" as perceived by consumers is largely price-based.  So while they could probably sell the Nook at $99 and still make a nice profit, people might perceive it as being a \"cheap\" eBook and buy a more expensive competitor (strange but true).  If they can get the Nook down to $99 using some deal, or rebate, or coupon for Christmas, I think they could be a run-away bestseller.\r\n<h2>Needs To Improve</h2>\r\n<h4>PDF</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-253\" title=\"pdf-file-logo-icon\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>I want/need good PDF support on the Nook if I ever hope for it to replace some of the things I do with self-published documents (e.g. agendas, reports, reference materials), and PDF is the dominant formatted document format on the web.  The current rev of the Nook software (1.0.0) has very underwhelming support for PDF.  If the PDF is just basic text, the built-in reader does a fair job of scaling and paging through the content.  If there are full-screen pages with a mixture of text and images it either renders them too small to see (with no easy zoom) or fails to render them completely.  I tried loading some schedules for local art and music festivals onto the device, which I could read fine on my computer at home, and they would not even render on the Nook.\r\n\r\nThe good news here is that there are better PDF-readers already working on the Nook, but you have to \"root\' the device and install an alternative version of Android (the base operating system of the Nook) on the Nook to add other native Android applications (several of which are more full-powered PDF readers).  So this is something that Barnes &amp; Noble could (and should) fix if enough people remind them that they need to do this soon.  The Nook has plenty of horsepower to do a much better job of PDF rendering.\r\n<h4>Search Speed</h4>\r\nI tried a few times to search for a key word or phrase in the <em>Penrod</em> book during a book club discussion - thinking it would search \"close\" to the page I was on and show me where the word was used.  Instead the reader took 30+ seconds to search the entire text of the book and show me every usage of the word(s) throughout the entire book.  Not only did this take way too long (having written search algorithms on far bigger sets of data on lesser-powered machines) but it ended up not being helpful at all as I lost the context of the page that I was on and had to page through the search results.  With the extra space on the device, it could index the contents and store the results to provide a \"nearest found\" search result, much faster, with the option for the complete search as well.\r\n<h4>Annotations</h4>\r\nUsing the touch screen you can put-and-hold your finger on any word to select the word.  Then you have the option to get a quick dictionary definition (works very nice), leave a \"highlight\" on the word, or add a note (with a surprisingly responsive pop-up keyboard).  But selecting a phrase or sentence is quite difficult. You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\r\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\r\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\r\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-254\" title=\"bnstore\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>One of the selling points of the Nook is supposed to be that you can bring it into one of their \"brick &amp; mortar\" stores and read books for free and get a bunch of incentives.  Another benefit to the store experience is the idea that there would always be someone at the store at the \"Nook desk\" to help people, give advice, and answer questions.  I must have hit a bad day last week when I swung by the Woodland Barnes &amp; Noble store.  The Nook wouldn\'t connect to the in-store network - it would connect to the bar next store, but then the Nook would immediately drop that network because it saw the Barnes &amp; Noble network (I guess the store wireless network gets top priority when it appears - which is unfortunate because the bar network was working but the B&amp;N one was not).  So I went and talked to the \"Nook Lady\".  Turns out that they haven\'t had any of the new Nooks in stock at the store so she hadn\'t really had time to use the new ones (even though there were some demo units on the front of the counter).  She didn\'t really know much about the new unit and couldn\'t help me get connected.  So this aspect was a bit disappointing, but I will try again if I am in the area.\r\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\r\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\r\nOne of the thing my old Newton did with text/books/formatted text was a basic text-to-speech (TTS) (and that was 18 years ago).  Sure it sounded like the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-244\" title=\"talking_moose\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/talking_moose1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"118\" /></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"> Talking Moose</a> but that was OK.  The Kindle has a basic \"read a book to you\" ability, which is a nearly common set of functionality nowadays.  The Nook has no headphone jack or speaker, and will not play audio books (though it certainly has enough space, enough power, and an operating system that would support it.  So to leave audio and TTS off of the Nook is a design choice - to focus on the readability of books and really very little else.  This is a \"missing feature\" but I am not sure that I miss it that much.  I have an iPod and a phone that plays MP3s, and I like to read books (which is why I got the Nook).\r\n<h4>Color?</h4>\r\nIf you had a TV that \"went back\" to black and white that would be quite silly - same with just about any other technology.  The iPad screen and iPhone screens are very nice, and the Nook Color is a great and inexpensive tablet.  They can play games and people do read books on the iPad (even if the eye strain is measurably more intense over a period of time).  I think the problem here is two things: (1) glare/outdoor reading and (2) battery life.  I have read my Nook in direct sunlight with sunglasses on and it works like a charm - other people who stopped to look were really amazed.  Many people couldn\'t even see their cell phones in the direct sun.  It is a great screen in all lighting conditions (except dark in bed) and from just about any angle.  Also a backlit and full-color screen uses a great deal of power and causes such devices to need daily recharges - a fact I really appreciate about the Nook.  There are some great E Ink Color Screen like the <a href=\"http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/demo\">Mirasol screen</a>, but they aren\'t in real production yet.  Maybe when those screens hit prime time we\'ll see a nice color E-book Reader.\r\n<h4>RSS / News Reader / Browser</h4>\r\nThere is a \"hidden\" browser on the nook - just type in something that looks like a web address (e.g. bn.com) and it will open in a browser that works via the wifi connection.  The browser is really bad. There is a reason it isn\'t obvious.  If a web site has a functional mobile-formatted web site, then it has a chance of working.  If not, most of the time you get a blank white screen.  I read daily news in the morning and it would sure be nice to have a set of web sites that were set up to work with the Nook browser.  I know the main \"point\" of the Nook for B&amp;N is to sell books, and even subscriptions, and \"free online news\" goes against this goal.  But it\'d be nice.  In the same vein as the better PDF reader available if you hack/root your Nook.  There are several much better browsers available for Android that could be adapted for the Nook.  I am going to leave the Nook \"stock\" for a while, but if there isn\'t progress on the PDF and Browser / Reader front then I might be tempted to try out some of the alternate operating systems.\r\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://calibre-ebook.com/\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-269\" title=\"calibre-logo\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/calibre-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"169\" height=\"112\" /></a>This will probably be another post entirely - as this review is already 2-3x too long.  But I have to mention the<a href=\"http://calibre-ebook.com/\"> Calibre software</a> for your personal computer.  Calibre handles a bunch of the issues I mentioned in this review and adds an entire new dimension to the Nook (and other E-book Readers).  It will help you to find free books, download them, catalog them, transfer them to your Nook.  It will also subscribe to any syndicated news feed or blog on the internet and will automatically grab them on a scheduled basis (and move them to your Nook).  This has really be a lifesaver for me in the news area and I am using it to catalog the literally hundreds of public domain books that are available online.\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation, but the first month with the Nook has been really positive.  I want to do some experiments with the ePub library and create some online reports and materials that work well with the Nook.  The Nook has replaced many of my book needs and has great potential.  I look forward to news and updates from Barnes &amp; Noble that might fill in some of the gaps that the 1.0.0 version has.  I\'ll keep you updated.','Nook Simple Touch Reader - First Month','','publish','open','open','','nook-simple-touch-reader-first-month','','','2011-07-06 21:03:31','2011-07-07 01:03:31','',0,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/?p=232',0,'post','',0),(234,2,'2011-07-06 15:53:00','2011-07-06 19:53:00','For Father’s Day this year I got a new Nook “Simple Touch Reader” so I have had it for about a month – time for a review.  I figure it was time when the “battery warning” came on yesterday and it told me I was down to 20% of capacity, so I decided to charge it up.  Going for a little over a month on the original 9 hour charge is one of the best aspects of this device.\r\n\r\nGetting right to the point, I am very happy with the overall performance and features of the Nook – the size, screen, user experience, format, battery life, price and storage capacity create a great package for casual and serious reading.\r\n<h2>Books on my Nook</h2>\r\nIn the month I have had the Nook, I have read several complete books on the device.  A typical “Nook day” for me will start at 7:00am with some devotions and current events with the family (more on the news feeds and features a little later).  Our summer “book club” has taken us through <em><strong>Penrod</strong></em> by Booth Tarkington, and now mid-way through <em><strong>The Princess and the Goblin</strong></em> by George MacDonald.  After hearing a lot of chatter online, I “checked out” <em><strong>A Game of Thrones</strong></em> by George R.R Martin from the Kent District Library (KDL) / Midwest Collaborative for Library Services (MCLS).  I also got <em><strong>How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming</strong></em> by Mike Brown, and <em><strong>SEAL Team Six</strong></em> by Howard E. Wasdin, mainly because I liked the titles, but also because I was curious about more background of recent events.  I added some PDF study guides made from Word files for some Microsoft certification tests I am studying for as well (more on the lackluster PDF support of the Nook below as well). I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\r\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\r\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features\r\n<h4>Size</h4>\r\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\r\n<h4>Screen</h4>\r\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color. But now I am sold.  The black and white contrast ratios (“distance” from black to white) on my old Apple Newton or Palm Pilot (which I brought out for comparison) are about what you’d find on some old dot-matrix printer on newsprint.  These new “Pearl E Ink” displays are much more like a laser printer on nice white bond paper – as good, or better than most paperbacks and close to some hardcovers. I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\r\nTouch screen\r\n\r\nSmartly-placed physical buttons\r\n\r\n<strong>Format</strong>\r\n\r\nI wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there\r\n\r\nePub w/ w/o DRM\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nThe claim from Barnes &amp; Noble was that you could get up to two months of battery life with the new Nook.  I did the initial charge of the Nook with the charger to the wall, and it was only after about a month that it started complaining that it wanted a recharge at 20% capacity.  I have, however, plugged the Nook on to the USB cable to load books and news feeds and I know that it does charge while connected, so I am sure it got some non-trivial electrons that way.  I have also left the WiFi radio on continuously since I got the device so I know that drains the battery as well.  My gut feel is that 2 months would really be a stretch, but that 3-4 weeks may be the reality – which is really a huge improvement over tablet and phone type devices.\r\n\r\nMy one beef about the battery is that it has followed the Apple model of being\r\n<h4>Memory / Expansion</h4>\r\n<h4>Price</h4>\r\n<h2>Needs To Improve</h2>\r\n<h4>PDF</h4>\r\n<h4>Search Speed</h4>\r\n<h4>Annotations</h4>\r\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\r\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\r\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\r\n<h4>Color?</h4>\r\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Touch','','inherit','open','open','','232-revision-2','','','2011-07-06 15:53:00','2011-07-06 19:53:00','',232,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/232-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(233,2,'2011-07-06 15:51:33','2011-07-06 19:51:33','<p>For Father’s Day this year I got a new Nook “Simple Touch Reader” so I have had it for about a month – time for a review.&nbsp; I figure it was time when the “battery warning” came on yesterday and it told me I was down to 20% of capacity, so I decided to charge it up.&nbsp; Going for a little over a month on the original 9 hour charge is one of the best aspects of this device.</p> <p>Getting right to the point, I am very happy with the overall performance and features of the Nook – the size, screen, user experience, format, battery life, price and storage capacity create a great package for casual and serious reading.</p> <h2>Books on my Nook</h2> <p>In the month I have had the Nook, I have read several complete books on the device.&nbsp; A typical “Nook day” for me will start at 7:00am with some devotions and current events with the family (more on the news feeds and features a little later).&nbsp; Our summer “book club” has taken us through <em><strong>Penrod</strong></em> by Booth Tarkington, and now mid-way through <em><strong>The Princess and the Goblin</strong></em> by George MacDonald.&nbsp; After hearing a lot of chatter online, I “checked out” <em><strong>A Game of Thrones</strong></em> by George R.R Martin from the Kent District Library (KDL) / Midwest Collaborative for Library Services (MCLS).&nbsp; I also got <em><strong>How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming</strong></em> by Mike Brown, and <em><strong>SEAL Team Six</strong></em> by Howard E.

Noble was that you could get up to two months of battery life with the new Nook.  I did the initial charge of the Nook with the charger to the wall, and it was only after about a month that it started complaining that it wanted a recharge at 20% capacity.  I have, however, plugged the Nook on to the USB cable to load books and news feeds and I know that it does charge while connected, so I am sure it got some non-trivial electrons that way.  I have also left the WiFi radio on continuously since I got the device so I know that drains the battery as well.  My gut feel is that 2 months would really be a stretch, but that 3-4 weeks may be the reality – which is really a huge improvement over tablet and phone type devices.\n\nMy one beef about the battery is that it has followed the Apple model of being not easily end-user maintainable.  All batteries lose power and capacity over time so it\'d be nice to be able to change the battery fairly easily.  There are kits available online for $15-30 with videos and the tools necessary to complete the \"operation\" - but it can be uncomfortable for end-users to have to \"crack\" the case, remove ribbon cables, and see circuit boards/screen in order to change the battery.\n<h4>Memory / Expansion</h4>\nThe Nook comes with 2 Gb of internal storage, which (ironically) doesn\'t sound like much, until you realize that the average ePub book is about 200-400kb so that is thousands of books on the device.  But, just in case there are new and different things to do with the Nook that are an order of magnitude bigger than current eBooks, the Nook also has a mini-SD slot that will take up to 32Gb of additional storage.  This is more books than you have ever read, and ever will read.  The base memory is nice, and the user-enabled expansion is overkill.\n<h4>Price</h4>\nThe base price of the new reader came out at $139, which had the nice side-effect of sending the smaller Kindle down to this price point as well.  They are still probably marking up this device 50%-75% from the production cost.  I know \"value\" as perceived by consumers is largely price-based.  So while they could probably sell the Nook at $99 and still make a nice profit, people might perceive it as being a \"cheap\" eBook and buy a more expensive competitor (strange but true).  If they can get the Nook down to $99 using some deal, or rebate, or coupon for Christmas, I think they could be a run-away bestseller.\n<h2>Needs To Improve</h2>\n<h4>PDF</h4>\nI want/need good PDF support on the Nook if I ever hope for it to replace some of the things I do with self-published documents (e.g. agendas, reports, reference materials), and PDF is the dominant formatted document format on the web.  The current rev of the Nook software (1.0.0) has very underwhelming support for PDF.  If the PDF is just basic text, the built-in reader does a fair job of scaling and paging through the content.  If there are full-screen pages with a mixture of text and images it either renders them too small to see (with no easy zoom) or fails to render them completely.  I tried loading some schedules for local art and music festivals onto the device, which I could read fine on my computer at home, and they would not even render on the Nook.\n\nThe good news here is that there are better PDF-readers already working on the Nook, but you have to \"root\' the device and install an alternative version of Android (the base operating system of the Nook) on the Nook to add other native Android applications (several of which are more full-powered PDF readers).  So this is something that Barnes &amp; Noble could (and should) fix if enough people remind them that they need to do this soon.  The Nook has plenty of horsepower to do a much better job of PDF rendering.\n<h4>Search Speed</h4>\nI tried a few times to search for a key word or phrase in the <em>Penrod</em> book during a book club discussion - thinking it would search \"close\" to the page I was on and show me where the word was used.  Instead the reader took 30+ seconds to search the entire text of the book and show me every usage of the word(s) throughout the entire book.  Not only did this take way too long (having written search algorithms on far bigger sets of data on lesser-powered machines) but it ended up not being helpful at all as I lost the context of the page that I was on and had to page through the search results.  With the extra space on the device, it could index the contents and store the results to provide a \"nearest found\" search result, much faster, with the option for the complete search as well.\n<h4>Annotations</h4>\nUsing the touch screen you can put-and-hold your finger on any word to select the word.  Then you have the option to get a quick dictionary definition (works very nice), leave a \"highlight\" on the word, or add a note (with a surprisingly responsive pop-up keyboard).  But selecting a phrase or sentence is quite difficult. You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This s\n<h4>Battery</h4>\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\n<h4>Color?</h4>\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Touch','','inherit','open','open','','232-revision-4','','','2011-07-06 16:45:09','2011-07-06 20:45:09','',232,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/232-revision-4/',0,'revision','',0),(237,2,'2011-07-06 16:47:06','2011-07-06 20:47:06','For Father’s Day this year I got a new Nook “Simple Touch Reader” so I have had it for about a month – time for a review.  I figure it was time when the “battery warning” came on yesterday and it told me I was down to 20% of capacity, so I decided to charge it up.  Going for a little over a month on the original 9 hour charge is one of the best aspects of this device.\n\nGetting right to the point, I am very happy with the overall performance and features of the Nook – the size, screen, user experience, format, battery life, price and storage capacity create a great package for casual and serious reading.\n<h2>Books on my Nook</h2>\nIn the month I have had the Nook, I have read several complete books on the device.  A typical “Nook day” for me will start at 7:00am with some devotions and current events with the family (more on the news feeds and features a little later).  Our summer “book club” has taken us through <em><strong>Penrod</strong></em> by Booth Tarkington, and now mid-way through <em><strong>The Princess and the Goblin</strong></em> by George MacDonald.  After hearing a lot of chatter online, I “checked out” <em><strong>A Game of Thrones</strong></em> by George R.R Martin from the Kent District Library (KDL) / Midwest Collaborative for Library Services (MCLS).  I also got <em><strong>How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming</strong></em> by Mike Brown, and <em><strong>SEAL Team Six</strong></em> by Howard E.

You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\n<h4>Battery</h4>\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and they want $75 to have them change the battery - tec\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\n<h4>Color?</h4>\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Touch','','inherit','open','open','','232-revision-5','','','2011-07-06 16:47:06','2011-07-06 20:47:06','',232,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/232-revision-5/',0,'revision','',0),(238,2,'2011-07-06 16:47:23','2011-07-06 20:47:23','For Father’s Day this year I got a new Nook “Simple Touch Reader” so I have had it for about a month – time for a review.  I figure it was time when the “battery warning” came on yesterday and it told me I was down to 20% of capacity, so I decided to charge it up.  Going for a little over a month on the original 9 hour charge is one of the best aspects of this device.\r\n\r\nGetting right to the point, I am very happy with the overall performance and features of the Nook – the size, screen, user experience, format, battery life, price and storage capacity create a great package for casual and serious reading.\r\n<h2>Books on my Nook</h2>\r\nIn the month I have had the Nook, I have read several complete books on the device.  A typical “Nook day” for me will start at 7:00am with some devotions and current events with the family (more on the news feeds and features a little later).  Our summer “book club” has taken us through <em><strong>Penrod</strong></em> by Booth Tarkington, and now mid-way through <em><strong>The Princess and the Goblin</strong></em> by George MacDonald.  After hearing a lot of chatter online, I “checked out” <em><strong>A Game of Thrones</strong></em> by George R.R Martin from the Kent District Library (KDL) / Midwest Collaborative for Library Services (MCLS).  I also got <em><strong>How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming</strong></em> by Mike Brown, and <em><strong>SEAL Team Six</strong></em> by Howard E. Wasdin, mainly because I liked the titles, but also because I was curious about more background of recent events.  I added some PDF study guides made from Word files for some Microsoft certification tests I am studying for as well (more on the lackluster PDF support of the Nook below as well). I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\r\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\r\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features.  Now with the new Nook I am going to try it out and see how well it works for me - can it replace print books for the majority of the reading that I do?\r\n<h4>Size</h4>\r\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\r\n<h4>Screen</h4>\r\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color. But now I am sold.  The black and white contrast ratios (“distance” from black to white) on my old Apple Newton or Palm Pilot (which I brought out for comparison) are about what you’d find on some old dot-matrix printer on newsprint.  These new “Pearl E Ink” displays are much more like a laser printer on nice white bond paper – as good, or better than most paperbacks and close to some hardcovers. I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\r\nTouch screen\r\n\r\nSmartly-placed physical buttons\r\n\r\n<strong>Format</strong>\r\n\r\nI wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there - all but the Kindle which uses primarily the \"mobi\" book format.  So, while the Kindle has many/most of the free eBooks available now in the \"mobi\" format, and some libraries have started carrying some books for the Kindle, the ePub format is still the most widely supported.  This gap is closing quickly, but it is something that has been really useful to me so far.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that is attractive about the ePub format is that it has some nice computer programming APIs available for it.  All that means for me is that I can easily create ePub documents by writing computer software, which opens a world of opportunity going forward.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nThe claim from Barnes &amp;

You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\r\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\r\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\r\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\r\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\r\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\r\n<h4>Color?</h4>\r\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\r\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Touch','','inherit','open','open','','232-revision-7','','','2011-07-06 16:48:18','2011-07-06 20:48:18','',232,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/232-revision-7/',0,'revision','',0),(240,2,'2011-07-06 16:48:23','2011-07-06 20:48:23','For Father’s Day this year I got a new Nook “Simple Touch Reader” so I have had it for about a month – time for a review.  I figure it was time when the “battery warning” came on yesterday and it told me I was down to 20% of capacity, so I decided to charge it up.  Going for a little over a month on the original 9 hour charge is one of the best aspects of this device.\r\n\r\nGetting right to the point, I am very happy with the overall performance and features of the Nook – the size, screen, user experience, format, battery life, price and storage capacity create a great package for casual and serious reading.\r\n<h2>Books on my Nook</h2>\r\nIn the month I have had the Nook, I have read several complete books on the device.  A typical “Nook day” for me will start at 7:00am with some devotions and current events with the family (more on the news feeds and features a little later).  Our summer “book club” has taken us through <em><strong>Penrod</strong></em> by Booth Tarkington, and now mid-way through <em><strong>The Princess and the Goblin</strong></em> by George MacDonald.  After hearing a lot of chatter online, I “checked out” <em><strong>A Game of Thrones</strong></em> by George R.R Martin from the Kent District Library (KDL) / Midwest Collaborative for Library Services (MCLS).  I also got <em><strong>How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming</strong></em> by Mike Brown, and <em><strong>SEAL Team Six</strong></em> by Howard E. Wasdin, mainly because I liked the titles, but also because I was curious about more background of recent events.  I added some PDF study guides made from Word files for some Microsoft certification tests I am studying for as well (more on the lackluster PDF support of the Nook below as well). I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\r\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\r\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features.  Now with the new Nook I am going to try it out and see how well it works for me - can it replace print books for the majority of the reading that I do?\r\n<h4>Size</h4>\r\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\r\n<h4>Screen</h4>\r\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color. But now I am sold.  The black and white contrast ratios (“distance” from black to white) on my old Apple Newton or Palm Pilot (which I brought out for comparison) are about what you’d find on some old dot-matrix printer on newsprint.  These new “Pearl E Ink” displays are much more like a laser printer on nice white bond paper – as good, or better than most paperbacks and close to some hardcovers. I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\r\nTouch screen\r\n\r\nSmartly-placed physical buttons\r\n\r\n<strong>Format</strong>\r\n\r\nI wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there - all but the Kindle which uses primarily the \"mobi\" book format.  So, while the Kindle has many/most of the free eBooks available now in the \"mobi\" format, and some libraries have started carrying some books for the Kindle, the ePub format is still the most widely supported.  This gap is closing quickly, but it is something that has been really useful to me so far.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that is attractive about the ePub format is that it has some nice computer programming APIs available for it.  All that means for me is that I can easily create ePub documents by writing computer software, which opens a world of opportunity going forward.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nThe claim from Barnes &amp; Noble was that you could get up to two months of battery life with the new Nook.  I did the initial charge of the Nook with the charger to the wall, and it was only after about a month that it started complaining that it wanted a recharge at 20% capacity.  I have, however, plugged the Nook on to the USB cable to load books and news feeds and I know that it does charge while connected, so I am sure it got some non-trivial electrons that way.  I have also left the WiFi radio on continuously since I got the device so I know that drains the battery as well.  My gut feel is that 2 months would really be a stretch, but that 3-4 weeks may be the reality – which is really a huge improvement over tablet and phone type devices.\r\n\r\nMy one beef about the battery is that it has followed the Apple model of being not easily end-user maintainable.  All batteries lose power and capacity over time so it\'d be nice to be able to change the battery fairly easily.  There are kits available online for $15-30 with videos and the tools necessary to complete the \"operation\" - but it can be uncomfortable for end-users to have to \"crack\" the case, remove ribbon cables, and see circuit boards/screen in order to change the battery.\r\n<h4>Memory / Expansion</h4>\r\nThe Nook comes with 2 Gb of internal storage, which (ironically) doesn\'t sound like much, until you realize that the average ePub book is about 200-400kb so that is thousands of books on the device.  But, just in case there are new and different things to do with the Nook that are an order of magnitude bigger than current eBooks, the Nook also has a mini-SD slot that will take up to 32Gb of additional storage.  This is more books than you have ever read, and ever will read.  The base memory is nice, and the user-enabled expansion is overkill.\r\n<h4>Price</h4>\r\nThe base price of the new reader came out at $139, which had the nice side-effect of sending the smaller Kindle down to this price point as well.  They are still probably marking up this device 50%-75% from the production cost.  I know \"value\" as perceived by consumers is largely price-based.  So while they could probably sell the Nook at $99 and still make a nice profit, people might perceive it as being a \"cheap\" eBook and buy a more expensive competitor (strange but true).  If they can get the Nook down to $99 using some deal, or rebate, or coupon for Christmas, I think they could be a run-away bestseller.\r\n<h2>Needs To Improve</h2>\r\n<h4>PDF</h4>\r\nI want/need good PDF support on the Nook if I ever hope for it to replace some of the things I do with self-published documents (e.g. agendas, reports, reference materials), and PDF is the dominant formatted document format on the web.  The current rev of the Nook software (1.0.0) has very underwhelming support for PDF.  If the PDF is just basic text, the built-in reader does a fair job of scaling and paging through the content.  If there are full-screen pages with a mixture of text and images it either renders them too small to see (with no easy zoom) or fails to render them completely.  I tried loading some schedules for local art and music festivals onto the device, which I could read fine on my computer at home, and they would not even render on the Nook.\r\n\r\nThe good news here is that there are better PDF-readers already working on the Nook, but you have to \"root\' the device and install an alternative version of Android (the base operating system of the Nook) on the Nook to add other native Android applications (several of which are more full-powered PDF readers).  So this is something that Barnes &amp;

You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\r\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\r\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\r\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\r\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\r\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\r\n<h4>Color?</h4>\r\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\r\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Simple Touch Reader - First Month','','inherit','open','open','','232-revision-9','','','2011-07-06 16:48:37','2011-07-06 20:48:37','',232,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/232-revision-9/',0,'revision','',0),(242,2,'2011-07-06 16:48:40','2011-07-06 20:48:40','For Father’s Day this year I got a new Nook “Simple Touch Reader” so I have had it for about a month – time for a review.  I figure it was time when the “battery warning” came on yesterday and it told me I was down to 20% of capacity, so I decided to charge it up.  Going for a little over a month on the original 9 hour charge is one of the best aspects of this device.\r\n\r\nGetting right to the point, I am very happy with the overall performance and features of the Nook – the size, screen, user experience, format, battery life, price and storage capacity create a great package for casual and serious reading.\r\n<h2>Books on my Nook</h2>\r\nIn the month I have had the Nook, I have read several complete books on the device.  A typical “Nook day” for me will start at 7:00am with some devotions and current events with the family (more on the news feeds and features a little later).  Our summer “book club” has taken us through <em><strong>Penrod</strong></em> by Booth Tarkington, and now mid-way through <em><strong>The Princess and the Goblin</strong></em> by George MacDonald.  After hearing a lot of chatter online, I “checked out” <em><strong>A Game of Thrones</strong></em> by George R.R Martin from the Kent District Library (KDL) / Midwest Collaborative for Library Services (MCLS).  I also got <em><strong>How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming</strong></em> by Mike Brown, and <em><strong>SEAL Team Six</strong></em> by Howard E. Wasdin, mainly because I liked the titles, but also because I was curious about more background of recent events.  I added some PDF study guides made from Word files for some Microsoft certification tests I am studying for as well (more on the lackluster PDF support of the Nook below as well). I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\r\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\r\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features.  Now with the new Nook I am going to try it out and see how well it works for me - can it replace print books for the majority of the reading that I do?\r\n<h4>Size</h4>\r\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\r\n<h4>Screen</h4>\r\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color. But now I am sold.  The black and white contrast ratios (“distance” from black to white) on my old Apple Newton or Palm Pilot (which I brought out for comparison) are about what you’d find on some old dot-matrix printer on newsprint.  These new “Pearl E Ink” displays are much more like a laser printer on nice white bond paper – as good, or better than most paperbacks and close to some hardcovers. I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\r\nTouch screen\r\n\r\nSmartly-placed physical buttons\r\n\r\n<strong>Format</strong>\r\n\r\nI wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there - all but the Kindle which uses primarily the \"mobi\" book format.  So, while the Kindle has many/most of the free eBooks available now in the \"mobi\" format, and some libraries have started carrying some books for the Kindle, the ePub format is still the most widely supported.  This gap is closing quickly, but it is something that has been really useful to me so far.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that is attractive about the ePub format is that it has some nice computer programming APIs available for it.  All that means for me is that I can easily create ePub documents by writing computer software, which opens a world of opportunity going forward.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nThe claim from Barnes &amp; Noble was that you could get up to two months of battery life with the new Nook.  I did the initial charge of the Nook with the charger to the wall, and it was only after about a month that it started complaining that it wanted a recharge at 20% capacity.  I have, however, plugged the Nook on to the USB cable to load books and news feeds and I know that it does charge while connected, so I am sure it got some non-trivial electrons that way.  I have also left the WiFi radio on continuously since I got the device so I know that drains the battery as well.  My gut feel is that 2 months would really be a stretch, but that 3-4 weeks may be the reality – which is really a huge improvement over tablet and phone type devices.\r\n\r\nMy one beef about the battery is that it has followed the Apple model of being not easily end-user maintainable.  All batteries lose power and capacity over time so it\'d be nice to be able to change the battery fairly easily.  There are kits available online for $15-30 with videos and the tools necessary to complete the \"operation\" - but it can be uncomfortable for end-users to have to \"crack\" the case, remove ribbon cables, and see circuit boards/screen in order to change the battery.\r\n<h4>Memory / Expansion</h4>\r\nThe Nook comes with 2 Gb of internal storage, which (ironically) doesn\'t sound like much, until you realize that the average ePub book is about 200-400kb so that is thousands of books on the device.  But, just in case there are new and different things to do with the Nook that are an order of magnitude bigger than current eBooks, the Nook also has a mini-SD slot that will take up to 32Gb of additional storage.  This is more books than you have ever read, and ever will read.  The base memory is nice, and the user-enabled expansion is overkill.\r\n<h4>Price</h4>\r\nThe base price of the new reader came out at $139, which had the nice side-effect of sending the smaller Kindle down to this price point as well.  They are still probably marking up this device 50%-75% from the production cost.  I know \"value\" as perceived by consumers is largely price-based.  So while they could probably sell the Nook at $99 and still make a nice profit, people might perceive it as being a \"cheap\" eBook and buy a more expensive competitor (strange but true).  If they can get the Nook down to $99 using some deal, or rebate, or coupon for Christmas, I think they could be a run-away bestseller.\r\n<h2>Needs To Improve</h2>\r\n<h4>PDF</h4>\r\nI want/need good PDF support on the Nook if I ever hope for it to replace some of the things I do with self-published documents (e.g. agendas, reports, reference materials), and PDF is the dominant formatted document format on the web.  The current rev of the Nook software (1.0.0) has very underwhelming support for PDF.  If the PDF is just basic text, the built-in reader does a fair job of scaling and paging through the content.  If there are full-screen pages with a mixture of text and images it either renders them too small to see (with no easy zoom) or fails to render them completely.  I tried loading some schedules for local art and music festivals onto the device, which I could read fine on my computer at home, and they would not even render on the Nook.\r\n\r\nThe good news here is that there are better PDF-readers already working on the Nook, but you have to \"root\' the device and install an alternative version of Android (the base operating system of the Nook) on the Nook to add other native Android applications (several of which are more full-powered PDF readers).  So this is something that Barnes &amp; Noble could (and should) fix if enough people remind them that they need to do this soon.  The Nook has plenty of horsepower to do a much better job of PDF rendering.\r\n<h4>Search Speed</h4>\r\nI tried a few times to search for a key word or phrase in the <em>Penrod</em> book during a book club discussion - thinking it would search \"close\" to the page I was on and show me where the word was used.  Instead the reader took 30+ seconds to search the entire text of the book and show me every usage of the word(s) throughout the entire book.  Not only did this take way too long (having written search algorithms on far bigger sets of data on lesser-powered machines) but it ended up not being helpful at all as I lost the context of the page that I was on and had to page through the search results.  With the extra space on the device, it could index the contents and store the results to provide a \"nearest found\" search result, much faster, with the option for the complete search as well.\r\n<h4>Annotations</h4>\r\nUsing the touch screen you can put-and-hold your finger on any word to select the word.  Then you have the option to get a quick dictionary definition (works very nice), leave a \"highlight\" on the word, or add a note (with a surprisingly responsive pop-up keyboard).  But selecting a phrase or sentence is quite difficult. You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\r\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\r\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\r\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\r\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\r\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\r\n<h4>Color?</h4>\r\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\r\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Simple Touch Reader - First Month','','inherit','open','open','','232-revision-10','','','2011-07-06 16:48:40','2011-07-06 20:48:40','',232,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/232-revision-10/',0,'revision','',0),(243,2,'2011-07-06 20:08:08','2011-07-07 00:08:08','','talking_moose','','inherit','open','open','','talking_moose','','','2011-07-06 20:08:08','2011-07-07 00:08:08','',232,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/talking_moose.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(244,2,'2011-07-06 20:09:10','2011-07-07 00:09:10','','talking_moose','','inherit','open','open','','talking_moose-2','','','2011-07-06 20:09:10','2011-07-07 00:09:10','',232,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/talking_moose1.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(245,2,'2011-07-06 20:18:43','2011-07-07 00:18:43','For Father’s Day this year I got a new Nook “Simple Touch Reader” so I have had it for about a month – time for a review.  I figure it was time when the “battery warning” came on yesterday and it told me I was down to 20% of capacity, so I decided to charge it up.  Going for a little over a month on the original 9 hour charge is one of the best aspects of this device.\n\nGetting right to the point, I am very happy with the overall performance and features of the Nook – the size, screen, user experience, format, battery life, price and storage capacity create a great package for casual and serious reading.\n<h2>Books on my Nook</h2>\nIn the month I have had the Nook, I have read several complete books on the device.  A typical “Nook day” for me will start at 7:00am with some devotions and current events with the family (more on the news feeds and features a little later).  Our summer “book club” has taken us through <em><strong>Penrod</strong></em> by Booth Tarkington, and now mid-way through <em><strong>The Princess and the Goblin</strong></em> by George MacDonald.  After hearing a lot of chatter online, I “checked out” <em><strong>A Game of Thrones</strong></em> by George R.R Martin from the Kent District Library (KDL) / Midwest Collaborative for Library Services (MCLS).  I also got <em><strong>How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming</strong></em> by Mike Brown, and <em><strong>SEAL Team Six</strong></em> by Howard E.

techno-extortion is not nice.\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\nOne of the selling points of the Nook is supposed to be that you can bring it into one of their \"brick &amp; mortar\" stores and read books for free and get a bunch of incentives.  Another benefit to the store experience is the idea that there would always be someone at the store at the \"Nook desk\" to help people, give advice, and answer questions.  I must have hit a bad day last week when I swung by the Woodland Barnes &amp; Noble store.  The Nook wouldn\'t connect to the in-store network - it would connect to the bar next store, but then the Nook would immediately drop that network because it saw the Barnes &amp; Noble network (I guess the store wireless network gets top priority when it appears - which is unfortunate because the bar network was working but the B&amp;N one was not).  So I went and talked to the \"Nook Lady\".  Turns out that they haven\'t had any of the new Nooks in stock at the store so she hadn\'t really had time to use the new ones (even though there were some demo units on the front of the counter).  She didn\'t really know much about the new unit and couldn\'t help me get connected.  So this aspect was a bit disappointing, but I will try again if I am in the area.\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\nOne of the thing my old Newton did with text/books/formatted text was a basic text-to-speech (TTS) (and that was 18 years ago).  Sure it sounded like the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-244\" title=\"talking_moose\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/talking_moose1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"118\" /></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"> Talking Moose</a> but that was OK.  The Kindle has a basic \"read a book to you\" ability, which is a nearly common set of functionality nowadays.  The Nook has no headphone jack or speaker, and will not play audio books (though it certainly has enough space, enough power, and an operating system that would support it.  So to leave audio and TTS off of the Nook is a design choice - to focus on the readability of books and really very little else.  This is a \"missing feature\" but I am not sure that I miss it that much.  I have an iPod and a phone that plays MP3s, and I like to read books (which is why I got the Nook).\n<h4>Color?</h4>\nIf you had a TV that \"went back\" to black and white that would be quite silly - same with just about any other technology.  The iPad screen and iPhone screens are very nice, and the Nook Color is a great and inexpensive tablet.  They can play games and people do read books on the iPad (even if the eye strain is measurably more intense over a period of time).  I think the problem here is two things: (1) glare/outdoor reading and (2) battery life.  I have read my Nook in direct sunlight with sunglasses on and it works like a charm - other people who stopped to look were really amazed.  Many people couldn\'t even see their cell phones in the direct sun.  It is a great screen in all lighting conditions (except dark in bed) and from just about any angle.  Also a backlit and full-color screen uses a great deal of power and causes such devices to need daily recharges - a fact I really appreciate about the Nook.  There are some great E Ink Color Screen like the <a href=\"http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/demo\">Mirasol screen</a>, but they aren\'t in real production yet.  Maybe when those screens hit prime time we\'ll see a nice color E-book Reader.\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Simple Touch Reader -

Wasdin, mainly because I liked the titles, but also because I was curious about more background of recent events.  I added some PDF study guides made from Word files for some Microsoft certification tests I am studying for as well (more on the lackluster PDF support of the Nook below as well). I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\r\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\r\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features.  Now with the new Nook I am going to try it out and see how well it works for me - can it replace print books for the majority of the reading that I do?\r\n<h4>Size</h4>\r\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\r\n<h4>Screen</h4>\r\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color. But now I am sold.  The black and white contrast ratios (“distance” from black to white) on my old Apple Newton or Palm Pilot (which I brought out for comparison) are about what you’d find on some old dot-matrix printer on newsprint.  These new “Pearl E Ink” displays are much more like a laser printer on nice white bond paper – as good, or better than most paperbacks and close to some hardcovers. I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\r\nTouch screen\r\n\r\nSmartly-placed physical buttons\r\n\r\n<strong>Format</strong>\r\n\r\nI wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there - all but the Kindle which uses primarily the \"mobi\" book format.  So, while the Kindle has many/most of the free eBooks available now in the \"mobi\" format, and some libraries have started carrying some books for the Kindle, the ePub format is still the most widely supported.  This gap is closing quickly, but it is something that has been really useful to me so far.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that is attractive about the ePub format is that it has some nice computer programming APIs available for it.  All that means for me is that I can easily create ePub documents by writing computer software, which opens a world of opportunity going forward.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nThe claim from Barnes &amp; Noble was that you could get up to two months of battery life with the new Nook.  I did the initial charge of the Nook with the charger to the wall, and it was only after about a month that it started complaining that it wanted a recharge at 20% capacity.  I have, however, plugged the Nook on to the USB cable to load books and news feeds and I know that it does charge while connected, so I am sure it got some non-trivial electrons that way.  I have also left the WiFi radio on continuously since I got the device so I know that drains the battery as well.  My gut feel is that 2 months would really be a stretch, but that 3-4 weeks may be the reality – which is really a huge improvement over tablet and phone type devices.\r\n\r\nMy one beef about the battery is that it has followed the Apple model of being not easily end-user maintainable.  All batteries lose power and capacity over time so it\'d be nice to be able to change the battery fairly easily.  There are kits available online for $15-30 with videos and the tools necessary to complete the \"operation\" - but it can be uncomfortable for end-users to have to \"crack\" the case, remove ribbon cables, and see circuit boards/screen in order to change the battery.\r\n<h4>Memory / Expansion</h4>\r\nThe Nook comes with 2 Gb of internal storage, which (ironically) doesn\'t sound like much, until you realize that the average ePub book is about 200-400kb so that is thousands of books on the device.  But, just in case there are new and different things to do with the Nook that are an order of magnitude bigger than current eBooks, the Nook also has a mini-SD slot that will take up to 32Gb of additional storage.  This is more books than you have ever read, and ever will read.  The base memory is nice, and the user-enabled expansion is overkill.\r\n<h4>Price</h4>\r\nThe base price of the new reader came out at $139, which had the nice side-effect of sending the smaller Kindle down to this price point as well.  They are still probably marking up this device 50%-75% from the production cost.  I know \"value\" as perceived by consumers is largely price-based.  So while they could probably sell the Nook at $99 and still make a nice profit, people might perceive it as being a \"cheap\" eBook and buy a more expensive competitor (strange but true).  If they can get the Nook down to $99 using some deal, or rebate, or coupon for Christmas, I think they could be a run-away bestseller.\r\n<h2>Needs To Improve</h2>\r\n<h4>PDF</h4>\r\nI want/need good PDF support on the Nook if I ever hope for it to replace some of the things I do with self-published documents (e.g. agendas, reports, reference materials), and PDF is the dominant formatted document format on the web.  The current rev of the Nook software (1.0.0) has very underwhelming support for PDF.  If the PDF is just basic text, the built-in reader does a fair job of scaling and paging through the content.  If there are full-screen pages with a mixture of text and images it either renders them too small to see (with no easy zoom) or fails to render them completely.  I tried loading some schedules for local art and music festivals onto the device, which I could read fine on my computer at home, and they would not even render on the Nook.\r\n\r\nThe good news here is that there are better PDF-readers already working on the Nook, but you have to \"root\' the device and install an alternative version of Android (the base operating system of the Nook) on the Nook to add other native Android applications (several of which are more full-powered PDF readers).  So this is something that Barnes &amp; Noble could (and should) fix if enough people remind them that they need to do this soon.  The Nook has plenty of horsepower to do a much better job of PDF rendering.\r\n<h4>Search Speed</h4>\r\nI tried a few times to search for a key word or phrase in the <em>Penrod</em> book during a book club discussion - thinking it would search \"close\" to the page I was on and show me where the word was used.  Instead the reader took 30+ seconds to search the entire text of the book and show me every usage of the word(s) throughout the entire book.  Not only did this take way too long (having written search algorithms on far bigger sets of data on lesser-powered machines) but it ended up not being helpful at all as I lost the context of the page that I was on and had to page through the search results.  With the extra space on the device, it could index the contents and store the results to provide a \"nearest found\" search result, much faster, with the option for the complete search as well.\r\n<h4>Annotations</h4>\r\nUsing the touch screen you can put-and-hold your finger on any word to select the word.  Then you have the option to get a quick dictionary definition (works very nice), leave a \"highlight\" on the word, or add a note (with a surprisingly responsive pop-up keyboard).  But selecting a phrase or sentence is quite difficult. You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\r\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\r\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\r\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\r\nOne of the selling points of the Nook is supposed to be that you can bring it into one of their \"brick &amp; mortar\" stores and read books for free and get a bunch of incentives.  Another benefit to the store experience is the idea that there would always be someone at the store at the \"Nook desk\" to help people, give advice, and answer questions.  I must have hit a bad day last week when I swung by the Woodland Barnes &amp; Noble store.  The Nook wouldn\'t connect to the in-store network -

Noble could (and should) fix if enough people remind them that they need to do this soon.  The Nook has plenty of horsepower to do a much better job of PDF rendering.\r\n<h4>Search Speed</h4>\r\nI tried a few times to search for a key word or phrase in the <em>Penrod</em> book during a book club discussion - thinking it would search \"close\" to the page I was on and show me where the word was used.  Instead the reader took 30+ seconds to search the entire text of the book and show me every usage of the word(s) throughout the entire book.  Not only did this take way too long (having written search algorithms on far bigger sets of data on lesser-powered machines) but it ended up not being helpful at all as I lost the context of the page that I was on and had to page through the search results.  With the extra space on the device, it could index the contents and store the results to provide a \"nearest found\" search result, much faster, with the option for the complete search as well.\r\n<h4>Annotations</h4>\r\nUsing the touch screen you can put-and-hold your finger on any word to select the word.  Then you have the option to get a quick dictionary definition (works very nice), leave a \"highlight\" on the word, or add a note (with a surprisingly responsive pop-up keyboard).  But selecting a phrase or sentence is quite difficult. You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\r\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\r\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\r\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\r\nOne of the selling points of the Nook is supposed to be that you can bring it into one of their \"brick &amp; mortar\" stores and read books for free and get a bunch of incentives.  Another benefit to the store experience is the idea that there would always be someone at the store at the \"Nook desk\" to help people, give advice, and answer questions.  I must have hit a bad day last week when I swung by the Woodland Barnes &amp; Noble store.  The Nook wouldn\'t connect to the in-store network - it would connect to the bar next store, but then the Nook would immediately drop that network because it saw the Barnes &amp; Noble network (I guess the store wireless network gets top priority when it appears - which is unfortunate because the bar network was working but the B&amp;N one was not).  So I went and talked to the \"Nook Lady\".  Turns out that they haven\'t had any of the new Nooks in stock at the store so she hadn\'t really had time to use the new ones (even though there were some demo units on the front of the counter).  She didn\'t really know much about the new unit and couldn\'t help me get connected.  So this aspect was a bit disappointing, but I will try again if I am in the area.\r\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\r\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\r\nOne of the thing my old Newton did with text/books/formatted text was a basic text-to-speech (TTS) (and that was 18 years ago).  Sure it sounded like the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-244\" title=\"talking_moose\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/talking_moose1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"118\" /></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"> Talking Moose</a> but that was OK.  The Kindle has a basic \"read a book to you\" ability, which is a nearly common set of functionality nowadays.  The Nook has no headphone jack or speaker, and will not play audio books (though it certainly has enough space, enough power, and an operating system that would support it.  So to leave audio and TTS off of the Nook is a design choice - to focus on the readability of books and really very little else.  This is a \"missing feature\" but I am not sure that I miss it that much.  I have an iPod and a phone that plays MP3s, and I like to read books (which is why I got the Nook).\r\n<h4>Color?</h4>\r\nIf you had a TV that \"went back\" to black and white that would be quite silly - same with just about any other technology.  The iPad screen and iPhone screens are very nice, and the Nook Color is a great and inexpensive tablet.  They can play games and people do read books on the iPad (even if the eye strain is measurably more intense over a period of time).  I think the problem here is two things: (1) glare/outdoor reading and (2) battery life.  I have read my Nook in direct sunlight with sunglasses on and it works like a charm - other people who stopped to look were really amazed.  Many people couldn\'t even see their cell phones in the direct sun.  It is a great screen in all lighting conditions (except dark in bed) and from just about any angle.  Also a backlit and full-color screen uses a great deal of power and causes such devices to need daily recharges - a fact I really appreciate about the Nook.  There are some great E Ink Color Screen like the <a href=\"http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/demo\">Mirasol screen</a>, but they aren\'t in real production yet.  Maybe when those screens hit prime time we\'ll see a nice color E-book Reader.\r\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\r\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Simple Touch Reader - First Month','','inherit','open','open','','232-revision-13','','','2011-07-06 20:21:05','2011-07-07 00:21:05','',232,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/232-revision-13/',0,'revision','',0);

Wasdin, mainly because I liked the titles, but also because I was curious about more background of recent events.  I added some PDF study guides made from Word files for some Microsoft certification tests I am studying for as well (more on the lackluster PDF support of the Nook below as well). I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\r\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\r\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features.  Now with the new Nook I am going to try it out and see how well it works for me - can it replace print books for the majority of the reading that I do?\r\n<h4>Size</h4>\r\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\r\n<h4>Screen</h4>\r\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color. But now I am sold.  The black and white contrast ratios (“distance” from black to white) on my old Apple Newton or Palm Pilot (which I brought out for comparison) are about what you’d find on some old dot-matrix printer on newsprint.  These new “Pearl E Ink” displays are much more like a laser printer on nice white bond paper – as good, or better than most paperbacks and close to some hardcovers. I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\r\nTouch screen\r\n\r\nSmartly-placed physical buttons\r\n\r\n<strong>Format</strong>\r\n\r\nI wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there - all but the Kindle which uses primarily the \"mobi\" book format.  So, while the Kindle has many/most of the free eBooks available now in the \"mobi\" format, and some libraries have started carrying some books for the Kindle, the ePub format is still the most widely supported.  This gap is closing quickly, but it is something that has been really useful to me so far.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that is attractive about the ePub format is that it has some nice computer programming APIs available for it.  All that means for me is that I can easily create ePub documents by writing computer software, which opens a world of opportunity going forward.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nThe claim from Barnes &amp;

I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\r\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\r\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features.  Now with the new Nook I am going to try it out and see how well it works for me - can it replace print books for the majority of the reading that I do?\r\n<h4>Size</h4>\r\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\r\n<h4>Screen</h4>\r\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color. But now I am sold.  The black and white contrast ratios (“distance” from black to white) on my old Apple Newton or Palm Pilot (which I brought out for comparison) are about what you’d find on some old dot-matrix printer on newsprint.  These new “Pearl E Ink” displays are much more like a laser printer on nice white bond paper – as good, or better than most paperbacks and close to some hardcovers. I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\r\nTouch screen\r\n\r\nSmartly-placed physical buttons\r\n\r\n<strong>Format</strong>\r\n\r\nI wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there - all but the Kindle which uses primarily the \"mobi\" book format.  So, while the Kindle has many/most of the free eBooks available now in the \"mobi\" format, and some libraries have started carrying some books for the Kindle, the ePub format is still the most widely supported.  This gap is closing quickly, but it is something that has been really useful to me so far.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that is attractive about the ePub format is that it has some nice computer programming APIs available for it.  All that means for me is that I can easily create ePub documents by writing computer software, which opens a world of opportunity going forward.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nThe claim from Barnes &amp; Noble was that you could get up to two months of battery life with the new Nook.  I did the initial charge of the Nook with the charger to the wall, and it was only after about a month that it started complaining that it wanted a recharge at 20% capacity.  I have, however, plugged the Nook on to the USB cable to load books and news feeds and I know that it does charge while connected, so I am sure it got some non-trivial electrons that way.  I have also left the WiFi radio on continuously since I got the device so I know that drains the battery as well.  My gut feel is that 2 months would really be a stretch, but that 3-4 weeks may be the reality – which is really a huge improvement over tablet and phone type devices.\r\n\r\nMy one beef about the battery is that it has followed the Apple model of being not easily end-user maintainable.  All batteries lose power and capacity over time so it\'d be nice to be able to change the battery fairly easily.  There are kits available online for $15-30 with videos and the tools necessary to complete the \"operation\" - but it can be uncomfortable for end-users to have to \"crack\" the case, remove ribbon cables, and see circuit boards/screen in order to change the battery.\r\n<h4>Memory / Expansion</h4>\r\nThe Nook comes with 2 Gb of internal storage, which (ironically) doesn\'t sound like much, until you realize that the average ePub book is about 200-400kb so that is thousands of books on the device.  But, just in case there are new and different things to do with the Nook that are an order of magnitude bigger than current eBooks, the Nook also has a mini-SD slot that will take up to 32Gb of additional storage.  This is more books than you have ever read, and ever will read.  The base memory is nice, and the user-enabled expansion is overkill.\r\n<h4>Price</h4>\r\nThe base price of the new reader came out at $139, which had the nice side-effect of sending the smaller Kindle down to this price point as well.  They are still probably marking up this device 50%-75% from the production cost.  I know \"value\" as perceived by consumers is largely price-based.  So while they could probably sell the Nook at $99 and still make a nice profit, people might perceive it as being a \"cheap\" eBook and buy a more expensive competitor (strange but true).  If they can get the Nook down to $99 using some deal, or rebate, or coupon for Christmas, I think they could be a run-away bestseller.\r\n<h2>Needs To Improve</h2>\r\n<h4>PDF</h4>\r\nI want/need good PDF support on the Nook if I ever hope for it to replace some of the things I do with self-published documents (e.g. agendas, reports, reference materials), and PDF is the dominant formatted document format on the web.  The current rev of the Nook software (1.0.0) has very underwhelming support for PDF.  If the PDF is just basic text, the built-in reader does a fair job of scaling and paging through the content.  If there are full-screen pages with a mixture of text and images it either renders them too small to see (with no easy zoom) or fails to render them completely.  I tried loading some schedules for local art and music festivals onto the device, which I could read fine on my computer at home, and they would not even render on the Nook.\r\n\r\nThe good news here is that there are better PDF-readers already working on the Nook, but you have to \"root\' the device and install an alternative version of Android (the base operating system of the Nook) on the Nook to add other native Android applications (several of which are more full-powered PDF readers).  So this is something that Barnes &amp; Noble could (and should) fix if enough people remind them that they need to do this soon.  The Nook has plenty of horsepower to do a much better job of PDF rendering.\r\n<h4>Search Speed</h4>\r\nI tried a few times to search for a key word or phrase in the <em>Penrod</em> book during a book club discussion - thinking it would search \"close\" to the page I was on and show me where the word was used.  Instead the reader took 30+ seconds to search the entire text of the book and show me every usage of the word(s) throughout the entire book.  Not only did this take way too long (having written search algorithms on far bigger sets of data on lesser-powered machines) but it ended up not being helpful at all as I lost the context of the page that I was on and had to page through the search results.  With the extra space on the device, it could index the contents and store the results to provide a \"nearest found\" search result, much faster, with the option for the complete search as well.\r\n<h4>Annotations</h4>\r\nUsing the touch screen you can put-and-hold your finger on any word to select the word.  Then you have the option to get a quick dictionary definition (works very nice), leave a \"highlight\" on the word, or add a note (with a surprisingly responsive pop-up keyboard).  But selecting a phrase or sentence is quite difficult. You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\r\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\r\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\r\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\r\nOne of the selling points of the Nook is supposed to be that you can bring it into one of their \"brick &amp; mortar\" stores and read books for free and get a bunch of incentives.  Another benefit to the store experience is the idea that there would always be someone at the store at the \"Nook desk\" to help people, give advice, and answer questions.  I must have hit a bad day last week when I swung by the Woodland Barnes &amp; Noble store.  The Nook wouldn\'t connect to the in-store network - it would connect to the bar next store, but then the Nook would immediately drop that network because it saw the Barnes &amp; Noble network (I guess the store wireless network gets top priority when it appears - which is unfortunate because the bar network was working but the B&amp;N one was not).  So I went and talked to the \"Nook Lady\".  Turns out that they haven\'t had any of the new Nooks in stock at the store so she hadn\'t really had time to use the new ones (even though there were some demo units on the front of the counter).  She didn\'t really know much about the new unit and couldn\'t help me get connected.  So this aspect was a bit disappointing, but I will try again if I am in the area.\r\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\r\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\r\nOne of the thing my old Newton did with text/books/formatted text was a basic text-to-speech (TTS) (and that was 18 years ago).  Sure it sounded like the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-244\" title=\"talking_moose\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/talking_moose1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"118\" /></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"> Talking Moose</a> but that was OK.  The Kindle has a basic \"read a book to you\" ability, which is a nearly common set of functionality nowadays.  The Nook has no headphone jack or speaker, and will not play audio books (though it certainly has enough space, enough power, and an operating system that would support it.  So to leave audio and TTS off of the Nook is a design choice - to focus on the readability of books and really very little else.  This is a \"missing feature\" but I am not sure that I miss it that much.  I have an iPod and a phone that plays MP3s, and I like to read books (which is why I got the Nook).\r\n<h4>Color?</h4>\r\nIf you had a TV that \"went back\" to black and white that would be quite silly - same with just about any other technology.  The iPad screen and iPhone screens are very nice, and the Nook Color is a great and inexpensive tablet.  They can play games and people do read books on the iPad (even if the eye strain is measurably more intense over a period of time).  I think the problem here is two things: (1) glare/outdoor reading and (2) battery life.  I have read my Nook in direct sunlight with sunglasses on and it works like a charm - other people who stopped to look were really amazed.  Many people couldn\'t even see their cell phones in the direct sun.  It is a great screen in all lighting conditions (except dark in bed) and from just about any angle.  Also a backlit and full-color screen uses a great deal of power and causes such devices to need daily recharges - a fact I really appreciate about the Nook.  There are some great E Ink Color Screen like the <a href=\"http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/demo\">Mirasol screen</a>, but they aren\'t in real production yet.  Maybe when those screens hit prime time we\'ll see a nice color E-book Reader.\r\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\r\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Simple Touch Reader -

otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\r\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\r\nOne of the selling points of the Nook is supposed to be that you can bring it into one of their \"brick &amp; mortar\" stores and read books for free and get a bunch of incentives.  Another benefit to the store experience is the idea that there would always be someone at the store at the \"Nook desk\" to help people, give advice, and answer questions.  I must have hit a bad day last week when I swung by the Woodland Barnes &amp; Noble store.  The Nook wouldn\'t connect to the in-store network - it would connect to the bar next store, but then the Nook would immediately drop that network because it saw the Barnes &amp; Noble network (I guess the store wireless network gets top priority when it appears - which is unfortunate because the bar network was working but the B&amp;N one was not).  So I went and talked to the \"Nook Lady\".  Turns out that they haven\'t had any of the new Nooks in stock at the store so she hadn\'t really had time to use the new ones (even though there were some demo units on the front of the counter).  She didn\'t really know much about the new unit and couldn\'t help me get connected.  So this aspect was a bit disappointing, but I will try again if I am in the area.\r\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\r\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\r\nOne of the thing my old Newton did with text/books/formatted text was a basic text-to-speech (TTS) (and that was 18 years ago).  Sure it sounded like the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-244\" title=\"talking_moose\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/talking_moose1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"118\" /></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"> Talking Moose</a> but that was OK.  The Kindle has a basic \"read a book to you\" ability, which is a nearly common set of functionality nowadays.  The Nook has no headphone jack or speaker, and will not play audio books (though it certainly has enough space, enough power, and an operating system that would support it.  So to leave audio and TTS off of the Nook is a design choice - to focus on the readability of books and really very little else.  This is a \"missing feature\" but I am not sure that I miss it that much.  I have an iPod and a phone that plays MP3s, and I like to read books (which is why I got the Nook).\r\n<h4>Color?</h4>\r\nIf you had a TV that \"went back\" to black and white that would be quite silly - same with just about any other technology.  The iPad screen and iPhone screens are very nice, and the Nook Color is a great and inexpensive tablet.  They can play games and people do read books on the iPad (even if the eye strain is measurably more intense over a period of time).  I think the problem here is two things: (1) glare/outdoor reading and (2) battery life.  I have read my Nook in direct sunlight with sunglasses on and it works like a charm - other people who stopped to look were really amazed.  Many people couldn\'t even see their cell phones in the direct sun.  It is a great screen in all lighting conditions (except dark in bed) and from just about any angle.  Also a backlit and full-color screen uses a great deal of power and causes such devices to need daily recharges - a fact I really appreciate about the Nook.  There are some great E Ink Color Screen like the <a href=\"http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/demo\">Mirasol screen</a>, but they aren\'t in real production yet.  Maybe when those screens hit prime time we\'ll see a nice color E-book Reader.\r\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\r\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Simple Touch Reader -

Wasdin, mainly because I liked the titles, but also because I was curious about more background of recent events.  I added some PDF study guides made from Word files for some Microsoft certification tests I am studying for as well (more on the lackluster PDF support of the Nook below as well). I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\r\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\r\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features.  Now with the new Nook I am going to try it out and see how well it works for me - can it replace print books for the majority of the reading that I do?\r\n<h4>Size</h4>\r\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\r\n<h4>Screen</h4>\r\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color. But now I am sold.  The black and white contrast ratios (“distance” from black to white) on my old Apple Newton or Palm Pilot (which I brought out for comparison) are about what you’d find on some old dot-matrix printer on newsprint.  These new “Pearl E Ink” displays are much more like a laser printer on nice white bond paper – as good, or better than most paperbacks and close to some hardcovers. I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\r\nTouch screen\r\n\r\nSmartly-placed physical buttons\r\n\r\n<strong>Format</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-250\" title=\"epub-logo\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>I wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there - all but the Kindle which uses primarily the \"mobi\" book format.  So, while the Kindle has many/most of the free eBooks available now in the \"mobi\" format, and some libraries have started carrying some books for the Kindle, the ePub format is still the most widely supported.  This gap is closing quickly, but it is something that has been really useful to me so far.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that is attractive about the ePub format is that it has some nice computer programming APIs available for it.  All that means for me is that I can easily create ePub documents by writing computer software, which opens a world of opportunity going forward.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.techrepublic.com/photos/cracking-open-the-2011-barnes-noble-nook-e-book-reader-wi-fi/6243892?seq=15&amp;tag=thumbnail-view-selector;get-photo-roto\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-251\" title=\"nookbattery\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nookbattery-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>The claim from Barnes &amp; Noble was that you could get up to two months of battery life with the new Nook.  I did the initial charge of the Nook with the charger to the wall, and it was only after about a month that it started complaining that it wanted a recharge at 20% capacity.  I have, however, plugged the Nook on to the USB cable to load books and news feeds and I know that it does charge while connected, so I am sure it got some non-trivial electrons that way.  I have also left the WiFi radio on continuously since I got the device so I know that drains the battery as well.  My gut feel is that 2 months would really be a stretch, but that 3-4 weeks may be the reality – which is really a huge improvement over tablet and phone type devices.\r\n\r\nMy one beef about the battery is that it has followed the Apple model of being not easily end-user maintainable.  All batteries lose power and capacity over time so it\'d be nice to be able to change the battery fairly easily.  There are kits available online for $15-30 with videos and the tools necessary to complete the \"operation\" - but it can be uncomfortable for end-users to have to \"crack\" the case, remove ribbon cables, and see circuit boards/screen in order to change the battery.\r\n<h4>Memory / Expansion</h4>\r\nThe Nook comes with 2 Gb of internal storage, which (ironically) doesn\'t sound like much, until you realize that the average ePub book is about 200-400kb so that is thousands of books on the device.  But, just in case there are new and different things to do with the Nook that are an order of magnitude bigger than current eBooks, the Nook also has a mini-SD slot that will take up to 32Gb of additional storage.  This is more books than you have ever read, and ever will read.  The base memory is nice, and the user-enabled expansion is overkill.\r\n<h4>Price</h4>\r\nThe base price of the new reader came out at $139, which had the nice side-effect of sending the smaller Kindle down to this price point as well.  They are still probably marking up this device 50%-75% from the production cost.  I know \"value\" as perceived by consumers is largely price-based.  So while they could probably sell the Nook at $99 and still make a nice profit, people might perceive it as being a \"cheap\" eBook and buy a more expensive competitor (strange but true).  If they can get the Nook down to $99 using some deal, or rebate, or coupon for Christmas, I think they could be a run-away bestseller.\r\n<h2>Needs To Improve</h2>\r\n<h4>PDF</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-253\" title=\"pdf-file-logo-icon\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>I want/need good PDF support on the Nook if I ever hope for it to replace some of the things I do with self-published documents (e.g. agendas, reports, reference materials), and PDF is the dominant formatted document format on the web.  The current rev of the Nook software (1.0.0) has very underwhelming support for PDF.  If the PDF is just basic text, the built-in reader does a fair job of scaling and paging through the content.  If there are full-screen pages with a mixture of text and images it either renders them too small to see (with no easy zoom) or fails to render them completely.  I tried loading some schedules for local art and music festivals onto the device, which I could read fine on my computer at home, and they would not even render on the Nook.\r\n\r\nThe good news here is that there are better PDF-readers already working on the Nook, but you have to \"root\' the device and install an alternative version of Android (the base operating system of the Nook) on the Nook to add other native Android applications (several of which are more full-powered PDF readers).  So this is something that Barnes &amp; Noble could (and should) fix if enough people remind them that they need to do this soon.  The Nook has plenty of horsepower to do a much better job of PDF rendering.\r\n<h4>Search Speed</h4>\r\nI tried a few times to search for a key word or phrase in the <em>Penrod</em> book during a book club discussion - thinking it would search \"close\" to the page I was on and show me where the word was used.  Instead the reader took 30+ seconds to search the entire text of the book and show me every usage of the word(s) throughout the entire book.  Not only did this take way too long (having written search algorithms on far bigger sets of data on lesser-powered machines) but it ended up not being helpful at all as I lost the context of the page that I was on and had to page through the search results.  With the extra space on the device, it could index the contents and store the results to provide a \"nearest found\" search result, much faster, with the option for the complete search as well.\r\n<h4>Annotations</h4>\r\nUsing the touch screen you can put-and-hold your finger on any word to select the word.  Then you have the option to get a quick dictionary definition (works very nice), leave a \"highlight\" on the word, or add a note (with a surprisingly responsive pop-up keyboard).  But selecting a phrase or sentence is quite difficult. You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\r\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\r\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated -

I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\r\nTouch screen\r\n\r\nSmartly-placed physical buttons\r\n\r\n<strong>Format</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-250\" title=\"epub-logo\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>I wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there - all but the Kindle which uses primarily the \"mobi\" book format.  So, while the Kindle has many/most of the free eBooks available now in the \"mobi\" format, and some libraries have started carrying some books for the Kindle, the ePub format is still the most widely supported.  This gap is closing quickly, but it is something that has been really useful to me so far.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that is attractive about the ePub format is that it has some nice computer programming APIs available for it.  All that means for me is that I can easily create ePub documents by writing computer software, which opens a world of opportunity going forward.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.techrepublic.com/photos/cracking-open-the-2011-barnes-noble-nook-e-book-reader-wi-fi/6243892?seq=15&amp;tag=thumbnail-view-selector;get-photo-roto\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-251\" title=\"nookbattery\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nookbattery-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>The claim from Barnes &amp; Noble was that you could get up to two months of battery life with the new Nook.  I did the initial charge of the Nook with the charger to the wall, and it was only after about a month that it started complaining that it wanted a recharge at 20% capacity.  I have, however, plugged the Nook on to the USB cable to load books and news feeds and I know that it does charge while connected, so I am sure it got some non-trivial electrons that way.  I have also left the WiFi radio on continuously since I got the device so I know that drains the battery as well.  My gut feel is that 2 months would really be a stretch, but that 3-4 weeks may be the reality – which is really a huge improvement over tablet and phone type devices.\r\n\r\nMy one beef about the battery is that it has followed the Apple model of being not easily end-user maintainable.  All batteries lose power and capacity over time so it\'d be nice to be able to change the battery fairly easily.  There are kits available online for $15-30 with videos and the tools necessary to complete the \"operation\" - but it can be uncomfortable for end-users to have to \"crack\" the case, remove ribbon cables, and see circuit boards/screen in order to change the battery.\r\n<h4>Memory / Expansion</h4>\r\nThe Nook comes with 2 Gb of internal storage, which (ironically) doesn\'t sound like much, until you realize that the average ePub book is about 200-400kb so that is thousands of books on the device.  But, just in case there are new and different things to do with the Nook that are an order of magnitude bigger than current eBooks, the Nook also has a mini-SD slot that will take up to 32Gb of additional storage.  This is more books than you have ever read, and ever will read.  The base memory is nice, and the user-enabled expansion is overkill.\r\n<h4>Price</h4>\r\nThe base price of the new reader came out at $139, which had the nice side-effect of sending the smaller Kindle down to this price point as well.  They are still probably marking up this device 50%-75% from the production cost.  I know \"value\" as perceived by consumers is largely price-based.  So while they could probably sell the Nook at $99 and still make a nice profit, people might perceive it as being a \"cheap\" eBook and buy a more expensive competitor (strange but true).  If they can get the Nook down to $99 using some deal, or rebate, or coupon for Christmas, I think they could be a run-away bestseller.\r\n<h2>Needs To Improve</h2>\r\n<h4>PDF</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-253\" title=\"pdf-file-logo-icon\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>I want/need good PDF support on the Nook if I ever hope for it to replace some of the things I do with self-published documents (e.g. agendas, reports, reference materials), and PDF is the dominant formatted document format on the web.  The current rev of the Nook software (1.0.0) has very underwhelming support for PDF.  If the PDF is just basic text, the built-in reader does a fair job of scaling and paging through the content.  If there are full-screen pages with a mixture of text and images it either renders them too small to see (with no easy zoom) or fails to render them completely.  I tried loading some schedules for local art and music festivals onto the device, which I could read fine on my computer at home, and they would not even render on the Nook.\r\n\r\nThe good news here is that there are better PDF-readers already working on the Nook, but you have to \"root\' the device and install an alternative version of Android (the base operating system of the Nook) on the Nook to add other native Android applications (several of which are more full-powered PDF readers).  So this is something that Barnes &amp; Noble could (and should) fix if enough people remind them that they need to do this soon.  The Nook has plenty of horsepower to do a much better job of PDF rendering.\r\n<h4>Search Speed</h4>\r\nI tried a few times to search for a key word or phrase in the <em>Penrod</em> book during a book club discussion - thinking it would search \"close\" to the page I was on and show me where the word was used.  Instead the reader took 30+ seconds to search the entire text of the book and show me every usage of the word(s) throughout the entire book.  Not only did this take way too long (having written search algorithms on far bigger sets of data on lesser-powered machines) but it ended up not being helpful at all as I lost the context of the page that I was on and had to page through the search results.  With the extra space on the device, it could index the contents and store the results to provide a \"nearest found\" search result, much faster, with the option for the complete search as well.\r\n<h4>Annotations</h4>\r\nUsing the touch screen you can put-and-hold your finger on any word to select the word.  Then you have the option to get a quick dictionary definition (works very nice), leave a \"highlight\" on the word, or add a note (with a surprisingly responsive pop-up keyboard).  But selecting a phrase or sentence is quite difficult. You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\r\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\r\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\r\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-254\" title=\"bnstore\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>One of the selling points of the Nook is supposed to be that you can bring it into one of their \"brick &amp; mortar\" stores and read books for free and get a bunch of incentives.  Another benefit to the store experience is the idea that there would always be someone at the store at the \"Nook desk\" to help people, give advice, and answer questions.  I must have hit a bad day last week when I swung by the Woodland Barnes &amp; Noble store.  The Nook wouldn\'t connect to the in-store network - it would connect to the bar next store, but then the Nook would immediately drop that network because it saw the Barnes &amp; Noble network (I guess the store wireless network gets top priority when it appears - which is unfortunate because the bar network was working but the B&amp;N one was not).  So I went and talked to the \"Nook Lady\".  Turns out that they haven\'t had any of the new Nooks in stock at the store so she hadn\'t really had time to use the new ones (even though there were some demo units on the front of the counter).  She didn\'t really know much about the new unit and couldn\'t help me get connected.  So this aspect was a bit disappointing, but I will try again if I am in the area.\r\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\r\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\r\nOne of the thing my old Newton did with text/books/formatted text was a basic text-to-speech (TTS) (and that was 18 years ago).  Sure it sounded like the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-244\" title=\"talking_moose\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/talking_moose1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"118\" /></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"> Talking Moose</a> but that was OK.  The Kindle has a basic \"read a book to you\" ability, which is a nearly common set of functionality nowadays.  The Nook has no headphone jack or speaker, and will not play audio books (though it certainly has enough space, enough power, and an operating system that would support it.  So to leave audio and TTS off of the Nook is a design choice - to focus on the readability of books and really very little else.  This is a \"missing feature\" but I am not sure that I miss it that much.  I have an iPod and a phone that plays MP3s, and I like to read books (which is why I got the Nook).\r\n<h4>Color?</h4>\r\nIf you had a TV that \"went back\" to black and white that would be quite silly - same with just about any other technology.  The iPad screen and iPhone screens are very nice, and the Nook Color is a great and inexpensive tablet.  They can play games and people do read books on the iPad (even if the eye strain is measurably more intense over a period of time).  I think the problem here is two things: (1) glare/outdoor reading and (2) battery life.  I have read my Nook in direct sunlight with sunglasses on and it works like a charm - other people who stopped to look were really amazed.  Many people couldn\'t even see their cell phones in the direct sun.  It is a great screen in all lighting conditions (except dark in bed) and from just about any angle.  Also a backlit and full-color screen uses a great deal of power and causes such devices to need daily recharges - a fact I really appreciate about the Nook.  There are some great E Ink Color Screen like the <a href=\"http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/demo\">Mirasol screen</a>, but they aren\'t in real production yet.  Maybe when those screens hit prime time we\'ll see a nice color E-book Reader.\r\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\r\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Simple Touch Reader -

Wasdin, mainly because I liked the titles, but also because I was curious about more background of recent events.  I added some PDF study guides made from Word files for some Microsoft certification tests I am studying for as well (more on the lackluster PDF support of the Nook below as well). I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\r\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\r\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features.  Now with the new Nook I am going to try it out and see how well it works for me - can it replace print books for the majority of the reading that I do?\r\n<h4>Size</h4>\r\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\r\n<h4>Screen</h4>\r\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color.

which is unfortunate because the bar network was working but the B&amp;N one was not).  So I went and talked to the \"Nook Lady\".  Turns out that they haven\'t had any of the new Nooks in stock at the store so she hadn\'t really had time to use the new ones (even though there were some demo units on the front of the counter).  She didn\'t really know much about the new unit and couldn\'t help me get connected.  So this aspect was a bit disappointing, but I will try again if I am in the area.\r\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\r\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\r\nOne of the thing my old Newton did with text/books/formatted text was a basic text-to-speech (TTS) (and that was 18 years ago).  Sure it sounded like the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-244\" title=\"talking_moose\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/talking_moose1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"118\" /></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"> Talking Moose</a> but that was OK.  The Kindle has a basic \"read a book to you\" ability, which is a nearly common set of functionality nowadays.  The Nook has no headphone jack or speaker, and will not play audio books (though it certainly has enough space, enough power, and an operating system that would support it.  So to leave audio and TTS off of the Nook is a design choice - to focus on the readability of books and really very little else.  This is a \"missing feature\" but I am not sure that I miss it that much.  I have an iPod and a phone that plays MP3s, and I like to read books (which is why I got the Nook).\r\n<h4>Color?</h4>\r\nIf you had a TV that \"went back\" to black and white that would be quite silly - same with just about any other technology.  The iPad screen and iPhone screens are very nice, and the Nook Color is a great and inexpensive tablet.  They can play games and people do read books on the iPad (even if the eye strain is measurably more intense over a period of time).  I think the problem here is two things: (1) glare/outdoor reading and (2) battery life.  I have read my Nook in direct sunlight with sunglasses on and it works like a charm - other people who stopped to look were really amazed.  Many people couldn\'t even see their cell phones in the direct sun.  It is a great screen in all lighting conditions (except dark in bed) and from just about any angle.  Also a backlit and full-color screen uses a great deal of power and causes such devices to need daily recharges - a fact I really appreciate about the Nook.  There are some great E Ink Color Screen like the <a href=\"http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/demo\">Mirasol screen</a>, but they aren\'t in real production yet.  Maybe when those screens hit prime time we\'ll see a nice color E-book Reader.\r\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\r\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Simple Touch Reader -

Wasdin, mainly because I liked the titles, but also because I was curious about more background of recent events.  I added some PDF study guides made from Word files for some Microsoft certification tests I am studying for as well (more on the lackluster PDF support of the Nook below as well). I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\r\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\r\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features.  Now with the new Nook I am going to try it out and see how well it works for me - can it replace print books for the majority of the reading that I do?\r\n<h4>Size</h4>\r\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\r\n<h4>Screen</h4>\r\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color. But now I am sold.  The black and white contrast ratios (“distance” from black to white) on my old Apple Newton or Palm Pilot (which I brought out for comparison) are about what you’d find on some old dot-matrix printer on newsprint.  These new “Pearl E Ink” displays are much more like a laser printer on nice white bond paper – as good, or better than most paperbacks and close to some hardcovers. I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\r\nTouch screen\r\n\r\nSmartly-placed physical buttons\r\n\r\n<strong>Format</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo3.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-260\" title=\"epub-logo\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"135\" /></a>I wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there - all but the Kindle which uses primarily the \"mobi\" book format.  So, while the Kindle has many/most of the free eBooks available now in the \"mobi\" format, and some libraries have started carrying some books for the Kindle, the ePub format is still the most widely supported.  This gap is closing quickly, but it is something that has been really useful to me so far.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that is attractive about the ePub format is that it has some nice computer programming APIs available for it.  All that means for me is that I can easily create ePub documents by writing computer software, which opens a world of opportunity going forward.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.techrepublic.com/photos/cracking-open-the-2011-barnes-noble-nook-e-book-reader-wi-fi/6243892?seq=15&amp;tag=thumbnail-view-selector;get-photo-roto\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-251\" title=\"nookbattery\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nookbattery-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>The claim from Barnes &amp; Noble was that you could get up to two months of battery life with the new Nook.  I did the initial charge of the Nook with the charger to the wall, and it was only after about a month that it started complaining that it wanted a recharge at 20% capacity.  I have, however, plugged the Nook on to the USB cable to load books and news feeds and I know that it does charge while connected, so I am sure it got some non-trivial electrons that way.  I have also left the WiFi radio on continuously since I got the device so I know that drains the battery as well.  My gut feel is that 2 months would really be a stretch, but that 3-4 weeks may be the reality – which is really a huge improvement over tablet and phone type devices.\r\n\r\nMy one beef about the battery is that it has followed the Apple model of being not easily end-user maintainable.  All batteries lose power and capacity over time so it\'d be nice to be able to change the battery fairly easily.  There are kits available online for $15-30 with videos and the tools necessary to complete the \"operation\" - but it can be uncomfortable for end-users to have to \"crack\" the case, remove ribbon cables, and see circuit boards/screen in order to change the battery.\r\n<h4>Memory / Expansion</h4>\r\nThe Nook comes with 2 Gb of internal storage, which (ironically) doesn\'t sound like much, until you realize that the average ePub book is about 200-400kb so that is thousands of books on the device.  But, just in case there are new and different things to do with the Nook that are an order of magnitude bigger than current eBooks, the Nook also has a mini-SD slot that will take up to 32Gb of additional storage.  This is more books than you have ever read, and ever will read.  The base memory is nice, and the user-enabled expansion is overkill.\r\n<h4>Price</h4>\r\nThe base price of the new reader came out at $139, which had the nice side-effect of sending the smaller Kindle down to this price point as well.  They are still probably marking up this device 50%-75% from the production cost.  I know \"value\" as perceived by consumers is largely price-based.  So while they could probably sell the Nook at $99 and still make a nice profit, people might perceive it as being a \"cheap\" eBook and buy a more expensive competitor (strange but true).  If they can get the Nook down to $99 using some deal, or rebate, or coupon for Christmas, I think they could be a run-away bestseller.\r\n<h2>Needs To Improve</h2>\r\n<h4>PDF</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-253\" title=\"pdf-file-logo-icon\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>I want/need good PDF support on the Nook if I ever hope for it to replace some of the things I do with self-published documents (e.g. agendas, reports, reference materials), and PDF is the dominant formatted document format on the web.  The current rev of the Nook software (1.0.0) has very underwhelming support for PDF.  If the PDF is just basic text, the built-in reader does a fair job of scaling and paging through the content.  If there are full-screen pages with a mixture of text and images it either renders them too small to see (with no easy zoom) or fails to render them completely.  I tried loading some schedules for local art and music festivals onto the device, which I could read fine on my computer at home, and they would not even render on the Nook.\r\n\r\nThe good news here is that there are better PDF-readers already working on the Nook, but you have to \"root\' the device and install an alternative version of Android (the base operating system of the Nook) on the Nook to add other native Android applications (several of which are more full-powered PDF readers).  So this is something that Barnes &amp; Noble could (and should) fix if enough people remind them that they need to do this soon.  The Nook has plenty of horsepower to do a much better job of PDF rendering.\r\n<h4>Search Speed</h4>\r\nI tried a few times to search for a key word or phrase in the <em>Penrod</em> book during a book club discussion - thinking it would search \"close\" to the page I was on and show me where the word was used.  Instead the reader took 30+ seconds to search the entire text of the book and show me every usage of the word(s) throughout the entire book.  Not only did this take way too long (having written search algorithms on far bigger sets of data on lesser-powered machines) but it ended up not being helpful at all as I lost the context of the page that I was on and had to page through the search results.  With the extra space on the device, it could index the contents and store the results to provide a \"nearest found\" search result, much faster, with the option for the complete search as well.\r\n<h4>Annotations</h4>\r\nUsing the touch screen you can put-and-hold your finger on any word to select the word.  Then you have the option to get a quick dictionary definition (works very nice), leave a \"highlight\" on the word, or add a note (with a surprisingly responsive pop-up keyboard).  But selecting a phrase or sentence is quite difficult. You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\r\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\r\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\r\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-254\" title=\"bnstore\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>One of the selling points of the Nook is supposed to be that you can bring it into one of their \"brick &amp; mortar\" stores and read books for free and get a bunch of incentives.  Another benefit to the store experience is the idea that there would always be someone at the store at the \"Nook desk\" to help people, give advice, and answer questions.  I must have hit a bad day last week when I swung by the Woodland Barnes &amp; Noble store.  The Nook wouldn\'t connect to the in-store network -

Noble was that you could get up to two months of battery life with the new Nook.  I did the initial charge of the Nook with the charger to the wall, and it was only after about a month that it started complaining that it wanted a recharge at 20% capacity.  I have, however, plugged the Nook on to the USB cable to load books and news feeds and I know that it does charge while connected, so I am sure it got some non-trivial electrons that way.  I have also left the WiFi radio on continuously since I got the device so I know that drains the battery as well.  My gut feel is that 2 months would really be a stretch, but that 3-4 weeks may be the reality – which is really a huge improvement over tablet and phone type devices.\r\n\r\nMy one beef about the battery is that it has followed the Apple model of being not easily end-user maintainable.  All batteries lose power and capacity over time so it\'d be nice to be able to change the battery fairly easily.  There are kits available online for $15-30 with videos and the tools necessary to complete the \"operation\" - but it can be uncomfortable for end-users to have to \"crack\" the case, remove ribbon cables, and see circuit boards/screen in order to change the battery.\r\n<h4>Memory / Expansion</h4>\r\nThe Nook comes with 2 Gb of internal storage, which (ironically) doesn\'t sound like much, until you realize that the average ePub book is about 200-400kb so that is thousands of books on the device.  But, just in case there are new and different things to do with the Nook that are an order of magnitude bigger than current eBooks, the Nook also has a mini-SD slot that will take up to 32Gb of additional storage.  This is more books than you have ever read, and ever will read.  The base memory is nice, and the user-enabled expansion is overkill.\r\n<h4>Price</h4>\r\nThe base price of the new reader came out at $139, which had the nice side-effect of sending the smaller Kindle down to this price point as well.  They are still probably marking up this device 50%-75% from the production cost.  I know \"value\" as perceived by consumers is largely price-based.  So while they could probably sell the Nook at $99 and still make a nice profit, people might perceive it as being a \"cheap\" eBook and buy a more expensive competitor (strange but true).  If they can get the Nook down to $99 using some deal, or rebate, or coupon for Christmas, I think they could be a run-away bestseller.\r\n<h2>Needs To Improve</h2>\r\n<h4>PDF</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-253\" title=\"pdf-file-logo-icon\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>I want/need good PDF support on the Nook if I ever hope for it to replace some of the things I do with self-published documents (e.g. agendas, reports, reference materials), and PDF is the dominant formatted document format on the web.  The current rev of the Nook software (1.0.0) has very underwhelming support for PDF.  If the PDF is just basic text, the built-in reader does a fair job of scaling and paging through the content.  If there are full-screen pages with a mixture of text and images it either renders them too small to see (with no easy zoom) or fails to render them completely.  I tried loading some schedules for local art and music festivals onto the device, which I could read fine on my computer at home, and they would not even render on the Nook.\r\n\r\nThe good news here is that there are better PDF-readers already working on the Nook, but you have to \"root\' the device and install an alternative version of Android (the base operating system of the Nook) on the Nook to add other native Android applications (several of which are more full-powered PDF readers).  So this is something that Barnes &amp; Noble could (and should) fix if enough people remind them that they need to do this soon.  The Nook has plenty of horsepower to do a much better job of PDF rendering.\r\n<h4>Search Speed</h4>\r\nI tried a few times to search for a key word or phrase in the <em>Penrod</em> book during a book club discussion - thinking it would search \"close\" to the page I was on and show me where the word was used.  Instead the reader took 30+ seconds to search the entire text of the book and show me every usage of the word(s) throughout the entire book.  Not only did this take way too long (having written search algorithms on far bigger sets of data on lesser-powered machines) but it ended up not being helpful at all as I lost the context of the page that I was on and had to page through the search results.  With the extra space on the device, it could index the contents and store the results to provide a \"nearest found\" search result, much faster, with the option for the complete search as well.\r\n<h4>Annotations</h4>\r\nUsing the touch screen you can put-and-hold your finger on any word to select the word.  Then you have the option to get a quick dictionary definition (works very nice), leave a \"highlight\" on the word, or add a note (with a surprisingly responsive pop-up keyboard).  But selecting a phrase or sentence is quite difficult. You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\r\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\r\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\r\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-254\" title=\"bnstore\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>One of the selling points of the Nook is supposed to be that you can bring it into one of their \"brick &amp; mortar\" stores and read books for free and get a bunch of incentives.  Another benefit to the store experience is the idea that there would always be someone at the store at the \"Nook desk\" to help people, give advice, and answer questions.  I must have hit a bad day last week when I swung by the Woodland Barnes &amp; Noble store.  The Nook wouldn\'t connect to the in-store network - it would connect to the bar next store, but then the Nook would immediately drop that network because it saw the Barnes &amp; Noble network (I guess the store wireless network gets top priority when it appears - which is unfortunate because the bar network was working but the B&amp;N one was not).  So I went and talked to the \"Nook Lady\".  Turns out that they haven\'t had any of the new Nooks in stock at the store so she hadn\'t really had time to use the new ones (even though there were some demo units on the front of the counter).  She didn\'t really know much about the new unit and couldn\'t help me get connected.  So this aspect was a bit disappointing, but I will try again if I am in the area.\r\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\r\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\r\nOne of the thing my old Newton did with text/books/formatted text was a basic text-to-speech (TTS) (and that was 18 years ago).  Sure it sounded like the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-244\" title=\"talking_moose\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/talking_moose1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"118\" /></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"> Talking Moose</a> but that was OK.  The Kindle has a basic \"read a book to you\" ability, which is a nearly common set of functionality nowadays.  The Nook has no headphone jack or speaker, and will not play audio books (though it certainly has enough space, enough power, and an operating system that would support it.  So to leave audio and TTS off of the Nook is a design choice - to focus on the readability of books and really very little else.  This is a \"missing feature\" but I am not sure that I miss it that much.  I have an iPod and a phone that plays MP3s, and I like to read books (which is why I got the Nook).\r\n<h4>Color?</h4>\r\nIf you had a TV that \"went back\" to black and white that would be quite silly - same with just about any other technology.  The iPad screen and iPhone screens are very nice, and the Nook Color is a great and inexpensive tablet.  They can play games and people do read books on the iPad (even if the eye strain is measurably more intense over a period of time).  I think the problem here is two things: (1) glare/outdoor reading and (2) battery life.  I have read my Nook in direct sunlight with sunglasses on and it works like a charm - other people who stopped to look were really amazed.  Many people couldn\'t even see their cell phones in the direct sun.  It is a great screen in all lighting conditions (except dark in bed) and from just about any angle.  Also a backlit and full-color screen uses a great deal of power and causes such devices to need daily recharges - a fact I really appreciate about the Nook.  There are some great E Ink Color Screen like the <a href=\"http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/demo\">Mirasol screen</a>, but they aren\'t in real production yet.  Maybe when those screens hit prime time we\'ll see a nice color E-book Reader.\r\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\r\n<h4>Browser</h4>\r\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Simple Touch Reader -

Wasdin, mainly because I liked the titles, but also because I was curious about more background of recent events.  I added some PDF study guides made from Word files for some Microsoft certification tests I am studying for as well (more on the lackluster PDF support of the Nook below as well). I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\r\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\r\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features.  Now with the new Nook I am going to try it out and see how well it works for me - can it replace print books for the majority of the reading that I do?\r\n<h4>Size</h4>\r\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\r\n<h4>Screen</h4>\r\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color. But now I am sold.  The black and white contrast ratios (“distance” from black to white) on my old Apple Newton or Palm Pilot (which I brought out for comparison) are about what you’d find on some old dot-matrix printer on newsprint.  These new “Pearl E Ink” displays are much more like a laser printer on nice white bond paper – as good, or better than most paperbacks and close to some hardcovers. I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\r\nTouch screen\r\n\r\nSmartly-placed physical buttons\r\n\r\n<strong>Format</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo3.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-260\" title=\"epub-logo\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"135\" /></a>I wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there - all but the Kindle which uses primarily the \"mobi\" book format.  So, while the Kindle has many/most of the free eBooks available now in the \"mobi\" format, and some libraries have started carrying some books for the Kindle, the ePub format is still the most widely supported.  This gap is closing quickly, but it is something that has been really useful to me so far.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that is attractive about the ePub format is that it has some nice computer programming APIs available for it.  All that means for me is that I can easily create ePub documents by writing computer software, which opens a world of opportunity going forward.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.techrepublic.com/photos/cracking-open-the-2011-barnes-noble-nook-e-book-reader-wi-fi/6243892?seq=15&amp;tag=thumbnail-view-selector;get-photo-roto\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-251\" title=\"nookbattery\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nookbattery-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>The claim from Barnes &amp;

a fact I really appreciate about the Nook.  There are some great E Ink Color Screen like the <a href=\"http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/demo\">Mirasol screen</a>, but they aren\'t in real production yet.  Maybe when those screens hit prime time we\'ll see a nice color E-book Reader.\r\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\r\n<h4>Browser</h4>\r\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Simple Touch Reader -

Wasdin, mainly because I liked the titles, but also because I was curious about more background of recent events.  I added some PDF study guides made from Word files for some Microsoft certification tests I am studying for as well (more on the lackluster PDF support of the Nook below as well). I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\r\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\r\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features.  Now with the new Nook I am going to try it out and see how well it works for me - can it replace print books for the majority of the reading that I do?\r\n<h4>Size</h4>\r\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\r\n<h4>Screen</h4>\r\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color. But now I am sold.  The black and white contrast ratios (“distance” from black to white) on my old Apple Newton or Palm Pilot (which I brought out for comparison) are about what you’d find on some old dot-matrix printer on newsprint.  These new “Pearl E Ink” displays are much more like a laser printer on nice white bond paper – as good, or better than most paperbacks and close to some hardcovers. I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\r\nTouch screen\r\n\r\nSmartly-placed physical buttons\r\n\r\n<strong>Format</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo3.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-260\" title=\"epub-logo\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"135\" /></a>I wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there - all but the Kindle which uses primarily the \"mobi\" book format.  So, while the Kindle has many/most of the free eBooks available now in the \"mobi\" format, and some libraries have started carrying some books for the Kindle, the ePub format is still the most widely supported.  This gap is closing quickly, but it is something that has been really useful to me so far.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that is attractive about the ePub format is that it has some nice computer programming APIs available for it.  All that means for me is that I can easily create ePub documents by writing computer software, which opens a world of opportunity going forward.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.techrepublic.com/photos/cracking-open-the-2011-barnes-noble-nook-e-book-reader-wi-fi/6243892?seq=15&amp;tag=thumbnail-view-selector;get-photo-roto\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-251\" title=\"nookbattery\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nookbattery-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>The claim from Barnes &amp; Noble was that you could get up to two months of battery life with the new Nook.  I did the initial charge of the Nook with the charger to the wall, and it was only after about a month that it started complaining that it wanted a recharge at 20% capacity.  I have, however, plugged the Nook on to the USB cable to load books and news feeds and I know that it does charge while connected, so I am sure it got some non-trivial electrons that way.  I have also left the WiFi radio on continuously since I got the device so I know that drains the battery as well.  My gut feel is that 2 months would really be a stretch, but that 3-4 weeks may be the reality – which is really a huge improvement over tablet and phone type devices.\r\n\r\nMy one beef about the battery is that it has followed the Apple model of being not easily end-user maintainable.  All batteries lose power and capacity over time so it\'d be nice to be able to change the battery fairly easily.  There are kits available online for $15-30 with videos and the tools necessary to complete the \"operation\" - but it can be uncomfortable for end-users to have to \"crack\" the case, remove ribbon cables, and see circuit boards/screen in order to change the battery.\r\n<h4>Memory / Expansion</h4>\r\nThe Nook comes with 2 Gb of internal storage, which (ironically) doesn\'t sound like much, until you realize that the average ePub book is about 200-400kb so that is thousands of books on the device.  But, just in case there are new and different things to do with the Nook that are an order of magnitude bigger than current eBooks, the Nook also has a mini-SD slot that will take up to 32Gb of additional storage.  This is more books than you have ever read, and ever will read.  The base memory is nice, and the user-enabled expansion is overkill.\r\n<h4>Price</h4>\r\nThe base price of the new reader came out at $139, which had the nice side-effect of sending the smaller Kindle down to this price point as well.  They are still probably marking up this device 50%-75% from the production cost.  I know \"value\" as perceived by consumers is largely price-based.  So while they could probably sell the Nook at $99 and still make a nice profit, people might perceive it as being a \"cheap\" eBook and buy a more expensive competitor (strange but true).  If they can get the Nook down to $99 using some deal, or rebate, or coupon for Christmas, I think they could be a run-away bestseller.\r\n<h2>Needs To Improve</h2>\r\n<h4>PDF</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-253\" title=\"pdf-file-logo-icon\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>I want/need good PDF support on the Nook if I ever hope for it to replace some of the things I do with self-published documents (e.g. agendas, reports, reference materials), and PDF is the dominant formatted document format on the web.  The current rev of the Nook software (1.0.0) has very underwhelming support for PDF.  If the PDF is just basic text, the built-in reader does a fair job of scaling and paging through the content.  If there are full-screen pages with a mixture of text and images it either renders them too small to see (with no easy zoom) or fails to render them completely.  I tried loading some schedules for local art and music festivals onto the device, which I could read fine on my computer at home, and they would not even render on the Nook.\r\n\r\nThe good news here is that there are better PDF-readers already working on the Nook, but you have to \"root\' the device and install an alternative version of Android (the base operating system of the Nook) on the Nook to add other native Android applications (several of which are more full-powered PDF readers).  So this is something that Barnes &amp; Noble could (and should) fix if enough people remind them that they need to do this soon.  The Nook has plenty of horsepower to do a much better job of PDF rendering.\r\n<h4>Search Speed</h4>\r\nI tried a few times to search for a key word or phrase in the <em>Penrod</em> book during a book club discussion - thinking it would search \"close\" to the page I was on and show me where the word was used.  Instead the reader took 30+ seconds to search the entire text of the book and show me every usage of the word(s) throughout the entire book.  Not only did this take way too long (having written search algorithms on far bigger sets of data on lesser-powered machines) but it ended up not being helpful at all as I lost the context of the page that I was on and had to page through the search results.  With the extra space on the device, it could index the contents and store the results to provide a \"nearest found\" search result, much faster, with the option for the complete search as well.\r\n<h4>Annotations</h4>\r\nUsing the touch screen you can put-and-hold your finger on any word to select the word.  Then you have the option to get a quick dictionary definition (works very nice), leave a \"highlight\" on the word, or add a note (with a surprisingly responsive pop-up keyboard).  But selecting a phrase or sentence is quite difficult. You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\r\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\r\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\r\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-254\" title=\"bnstore\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>One of the selling points of the Nook is supposed to be that you can bring it into one of their \"brick &amp; mortar\" stores and read books for free and get a bunch of incentives.  Another benefit to the store experience is the idea that there would always be someone at the store at the \"Nook desk\" to help people, give advice, and answer questions.  I must have hit a bad day last week when I swung by the Woodland Barnes &amp; Noble store.  The Nook wouldn\'t connect to the in-store network - it would connect to the bar next store, but then the Nook would immediately drop that network because it saw the Barnes &amp; Noble network (I guess the store wireless network gets top priority when it appears - which is unfortunate because the bar network was working but the B&amp;N one was not).  So I went and talked to the \"Nook Lady\".  Turns out that they haven\'t had any of the new Nooks in stock at the store so she hadn\'t really had time to use the new ones (even though there were some demo units on the front of the counter).  She didn\'t really know much about the new unit and couldn\'t help me get connected.  So this aspect was a bit disappointing, but I will try again if I am in the area.\r\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\r\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\r\nOne of the thing my old Newton did with text/books/formatted text was a basic text-to-speech (TTS) (and that was 18 years ago).  Sure it sounded like the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-244\" title=\"talking_moose\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/talking_moose1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"118\" /></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"> Talking Moose</a> but that was OK.  The Kindle has a basic \"read a book to you\" ability, which is a nearly common set of functionality nowadays.  The Nook has no headphone jack or speaker, and will not play audio books (though it certainly has enough space, enough power, and an operating system that would support it.  So to leave audio and TTS off of the Nook is a design choice - to focus on the readability of books and really very little else.  This is a \"missing feature\" but I am not sure that I miss it that much.  I have an iPod and a phone that plays MP3s, and I like to read books (which is why I got the Nook).\r\n<h4>Color?</h4>\r\nIf you had a TV that \"went back\" to black and white that would be quite silly - same with just about any other technology.  The iPad screen and iPhone screens are very nice, and the Nook Color is a great and inexpensive tablet.  They can play games and people do read books on the iPad (even if the eye strain is measurably more intense over a period of time).  I think the problem here is two things: (1) glare/outdoor reading and (2) battery life.  I have read my Nook in direct sunlight with sunglasses on and it works like a charm - other people who stopped to look were really amazed.  Many people couldn\'t even see their cell phones in the direct sun.  It is a great screen in all lighting conditions (except dark in bed) and from just about any angle.  Also a backlit and full-color screen uses a great deal of power and causes such devices to need daily recharges - a fact I really appreciate about the Nook.  There are some great E Ink Color Screen like the <a href=\"http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/demo\">Mirasol screen</a>, but they aren\'t in real production yet.  Maybe when those screens hit prime time we\'ll see a nice color E-book Reader.\r\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\r\n<h4>Browser</h4>\r\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Simple Touch Reader -

Noble could (and should) fix if enough people remind them that they need to do this soon.  The Nook has plenty of horsepower to do a much better job of PDF rendering.\r\n<h4>Search Speed</h4>\r\nI tried a few times to search for a key word or phrase in the <em>Penrod</em> book during a book club discussion - thinking it would search \"close\" to the page I was on and show me where the word was used.  Instead the reader took 30+ seconds to search the entire text of the book and show me every usage of the word(s) throughout the entire book.  Not only did this take way too long (having written search algorithms on far bigger sets of data on lesser-powered machines) but it ended up not being helpful at all as I lost the context of the page that I was on and had to page through the search results.  With the extra space on the device, it could index the contents and store the results to provide a \"nearest found\" search result, much faster, with the option for the complete search as well.\r\n<h4>Annotations</h4>\r\nUsing the touch screen you can put-and-hold your finger on any word to select the word.  Then you have the option to get a quick dictionary definition (works very nice), leave a \"highlight\" on the word, or add a note (with a surprisingly responsive pop-up keyboard).  But selecting a phrase or sentence is quite difficult. You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\r\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\r\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\r\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-254\" title=\"bnstore\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>One of the selling points of the Nook is supposed to be that you can bring it into one of their \"brick &amp; mortar\" stores and read books for free and get a bunch of incentives.  Another benefit to the store experience is the idea that there would always be someone at the store at the \"Nook desk\" to help people, give advice, and answer questions.  I must have hit a bad day last week when I swung by the Woodland Barnes &amp; Noble store.  The Nook wouldn\'t connect to the in-store network - it would connect to the bar next store, but then the Nook would immediately drop that network because it saw the Barnes &amp; Noble network (I guess the store wireless network gets top priority when it appears - which is unfortunate because the bar network was working but the B&amp;N one was not).  So I went and talked to the \"Nook Lady\".  Turns out that they haven\'t had any of the new Nooks in stock at the store so she hadn\'t really had time to use the new ones (even though there were some demo units on the front of the counter).  She didn\'t really know much about the new unit and couldn\'t help me get connected.  So this aspect was a bit disappointing, but I will try again if I am in the area.\r\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\r\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\r\nOne of the thing my old Newton did with text/books/formatted text was a basic text-to-speech (TTS) (and that was 18 years ago).  Sure it sounded like the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-244\" title=\"talking_moose\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/talking_moose1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"118\" /></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"> Talking Moose</a> but that was OK.  The Kindle has a basic \"read a book to you\" ability, which is a nearly common set of functionality nowadays.  The Nook has no headphone jack or speaker, and will not play audio books (though it certainly has enough space, enough power, and an operating system that would support it.  So to leave audio and TTS off of the Nook is a design choice - to focus on the readability of books and really very little else.  This is a \"missing feature\" but I am not sure that I miss it that much.  I have an iPod and a phone that plays MP3s, and I like to read books (which is why I got the Nook).\r\n<h4>Color?</h4>\r\nIf you had a TV that \"went back\" to black and white that would be quite silly - same with just about any other technology.  The iPad screen and iPhone screens are very nice, and the Nook Color is a great and inexpensive tablet.  They can play games and people do read books on the iPad (even if the eye strain is measurably more intense over a period of time).  I think the problem here is two things: (1) glare/outdoor reading and (2) battery life.  I have read my Nook in direct sunlight with sunglasses on and it works like a charm - other people who stopped to look were really amazed.  Many people couldn\'t even see their cell phones in the direct sun.  It is a great screen in all lighting conditions (except dark in bed) and from just about any angle.  Also a backlit and full-color screen uses a great deal of power and causes such devices to need daily recharges - a fact I really appreciate about the Nook.  There are some great E Ink Color Screen like the <a href=\"http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/demo\">Mirasol screen</a>, but they aren\'t in real production yet.  Maybe when those screens hit prime time we\'ll see a nice color E-book Reader.\r\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\r\n<h4>Browser</h4>\r\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Simple Touch Reader -

Wasdin, mainly because I liked the titles, but also because I was curious about more background of recent events.  I added some PDF study guides made from Word files for some Microsoft certification tests I am studying for as well (more on the lackluster PDF support of the Nook below as well). I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\r\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\r\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features.  Now with the new Nook I am going to try it out and see how well it works for me - can it replace print books for the majority of the reading that I do?\r\n<h4>Size</h4>\r\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\r\n<h4>Screen</h4>\r\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color. But now I am sold.  The black and white contrast ratios (“distance” from black to white) on my old Apple Newton or Palm Pilot (which I brought out for comparison) are about what you’d find on some old dot-matrix printer on newsprint.  These new “Pearl E Ink” displays are much more like a laser printer on nice white bond paper – as good, or better than most paperbacks and close to some hardcovers. I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\r\nBy getting rid of the keyboard and bottom button bar on the previous Kindle and Nook and going with a touch screen, the new Nook has maximized the screen for reading and created a very effective user interface. The applications that come with the Nook to help to buy books and read them have big \"touchable buttons\" and work well with the screen.  You can turn a page by swiping/touching on the side of the page that you want to turn.  Touching in the middle of the screen brings up an option bar at the bottom for more tools\r\n\r\nThere are six smartly-placed physical buttons on the unit: the on/off button which is on the rear of the unit in the upper middle (no real risk of shutting things off unintentionally - in fact I don\'t remember ever turning it off as it sleeps on its own), the \"Nook\" button in the bottom middle which brings up the main option bar at the bottom that allows you to go to the top-level pages, and four page turning buttons which aren\'t as obvious on first look, but are my favorite and I use them constantly.  The four buttons are in two pairs on either side of the unit.  There is a slight ridge line for each button - one from the middle of the unit up and the other from the middle of the unit down.  These are for page turning and are configurable (i.e. top goes to next page or to bottom page - your choice).  For longer reading sessions it is nice to have these buttons there so you can hold the book in one hand and just \"squeeze\" a bit to turn the page.  There is an inaudible \"click\" but one that you feel to know that the button has been pressed - just enough to know you did it right and keep from accidentally pushing it, but not enough to be annoying.  I know some people turn pages with the touch screen, but I am all about the side buttons - very nice.\r\n\r\n<strong>Format</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo3.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-260\" title=\"epub-logo\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"135\" /></a>I wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there - all but the Kindle which uses primarily the \"mobi\" book format.  So, while the Kindle has many/most of the free eBooks available now in the \"mobi\" format, and some libraries have started carrying some books for the Kindle, the ePub format is still the most widely supported.  This gap is closing quickly, but it is something that has been really useful to me so far.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that is attractive about the ePub format is that it has some nice computer programming APIs available for it.  All that means for me is that I can easily create ePub documents by writing computer software, which opens a world of opportunity going forward.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.techrepublic.com/photos/cracking-open-the-2011-barnes-noble-nook-e-book-reader-wi-fi/6243892?seq=15&amp;tag=thumbnail-view-selector;get-photo-roto\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-251\" title=\"nookbattery\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nookbattery-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>The claim from Barnes &amp;

to focus on the readability of books and really very little else.  This is a \"missing feature\" but I am not sure that I miss it that much.  I have an iPod and a phone that plays MP3s, and I like to read books (which is why I got the Nook).\r\n<h4>Color?</h4>\r\nIf you had a TV that \"went back\" to black and white that would be quite silly - same with just about any other technology.  The iPad screen and iPhone screens are very nice, and the Nook Color is a great and inexpensive tablet.  They can play games and people do read books on the iPad (even if the eye strain is measurably more intense over a period of time).  I think the problem here is two things: (1) glare/outdoor reading and (2) battery life.  I have read my Nook in direct sunlight with sunglasses on and it works like a charm - other people who stopped to look were really amazed.  Many people couldn\'t even see their cell phones in the direct sun.  It is a great screen in all lighting conditions (except dark in bed) and from just about any angle.  Also a backlit and full-color screen uses a great deal of power and causes such devices to need daily recharges - a fact I really appreciate about the Nook.  There are some great E Ink Color Screen like the <a href=\"http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/demo\">Mirasol screen</a>, but they aren\'t in real production yet.  Maybe when those screens hit prime time we\'ll see a nice color E-book Reader.\r\n<h4>RSS / News Reader</h4>\r\n<h4>Browser</h4>\r\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation,','Nook Simple Touch Reader -

Wasdin, mainly because I liked the titles, but also because I was curious about more background of recent events.  I added some PDF study guides made from Word files for some Microsoft certification tests I am studying for as well (more on the lackluster PDF support of the Nook below as well). I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\r\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\r\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features.  Now with the new Nook I am going to try it out and see how well it works for me - can it replace print books for the majority of the reading that I do?\r\n<h4>Size</h4>\r\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\r\n<h4>Screen</h4>\r\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color. But now I am sold.  The black and white contrast ratios (“distance” from black to white) on my old Apple Newton or Palm Pilot (which I brought out for comparison) are about what you’d find on some old dot-matrix printer on newsprint.  These new “Pearl E Ink” displays are much more like a laser printer on nice white bond paper – as good, or better than most paperbacks and close to some hardcovers. I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\r\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\r\nBy getting rid of the keyboard and bottom button bar on the previous Kindle and Nook and going with a touch screen, the new Nook has maximized the screen for reading and created a very effective user interface. The applications that come with the Nook to help to buy books and read them have big \"touchable buttons\" and work well with the screen.  You can turn a page by swiping/touching on the side of the page that you want to turn.  Touching in the middle of the screen brings up an option bar at the bottom for more tools\r\n\r\nThere are six smartly-placed physical buttons on the unit: the on/off button which is on the rear of the unit in the upper middle (no real risk of shutting things off unintentionally - in fact I don\'t remember ever turning it off as it sleeps on its own), the \"Nook\" button in the bottom middle which brings up the main option bar at the bottom that allows you to go to the top-level pages, and four page turning buttons which aren\'t as obvious on first look, but are my favorite and I use them constantly.  The four buttons are in two pairs on either side of the unit.  There is a slight ridge line for each button - one from the middle of the unit up and the other from the middle of the unit down.  These are for page turning and are configurable (i.e. top goes to next page or to bottom page - your choice).  For longer reading sessions it is nice to have these buttons there so you can hold the book in one hand and just \"squeeze\" a bit to turn the page.  There is an inaudible \"click\" but one that you feel to know that the button has been pressed - just enough to know you did it right and keep from accidentally pushing it, but not enough to be annoying.  I know some people turn pages with the touch screen, but I am all about the side buttons - very nice.\r\n\r\n<strong>Format</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo3.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-260\" title=\"epub-logo\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"135\" /></a>I wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there - all but the Kindle which uses primarily the \"mobi\" book format.  So, while the Kindle has many/most of the free eBooks available now in the \"mobi\" format, and some libraries have started carrying some books for the Kindle, the ePub format is still the most widely supported.  This gap is closing quickly, but it is something that has been really useful to me so far.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that is attractive about the ePub format is that it has some nice computer programming APIs available for it.  All that means for me is that I can easily create ePub documents by writing computer software, which opens a world of opportunity going forward.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.techrepublic.com/photos/cracking-open-the-2011-barnes-noble-nook-e-book-reader-wi-fi/6243892?seq=15&amp;tag=thumbnail-view-selector;get-photo-roto\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-251\" title=\"nookbattery\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nookbattery-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>The claim from Barnes &amp; Noble was that you could get up to two months of battery life with the new Nook.  I did the initial charge of the Nook with the charger to the wall, and it was only after about a month that it started complaining that it wanted a recharge at 20% capacity.  I have, however, plugged the Nook on to the USB cable to load books and news feeds and I know that it does charge while connected, so I am sure it got some non-trivial electrons that way.  I have also left the WiFi radio on continuously since I got the device so I know that drains the battery as well.  My gut feel is that 2 months would really be a stretch, but that 3-4 weeks may be the reality – which is really a huge improvement over tablet and phone type devices.\r\n\r\nMy one beef about the battery is that it has followed the Apple model of being not easily end-user maintainable.  All batteries lose power and capacity over time so it\'d be nice to be able to change the battery fairly easily.  There are kits available online for $15-30 with videos and the tools necessary to complete the \"operation\" - but it can be uncomfortable for end-users to have to \"crack\" the case, remove ribbon cables, and see circuit boards/screen in order to change the battery.\r\n<h4>Memory / Expansion</h4>\r\nThe Nook comes with 2 Gb of internal storage, which (ironically) doesn\'t sound like much, until you realize that the average ePub book is about 200-400kb so that is thousands of books on the device.  But, just in case there are new and different things to do with the Nook that are an order of magnitude bigger than current eBooks, the Nook also has a mini-SD slot that will take up to 32Gb of additional storage.  This is more books than you have ever read, and ever will read.  The base memory is nice, and the user-enabled expansion is overkill.\r\n<h4>Price</h4>\r\nThe base price of the new reader came out at $139, which had the nice side-effect of sending the smaller Kindle down to this price point as well.  They are still probably marking up this device 50%-75% from the production cost.  I know \"value\" as perceived by consumers is largely price-based.  So while they could probably sell the Nook at $99 and still make a nice profit, people might perceive it as being a \"cheap\" eBook and buy a more expensive competitor (strange but true).  If they can get the Nook down to $99 using some deal, or rebate, or coupon for Christmas, I think they could be a run-away bestseller.\r\n<h2>Needs To Improve</h2>\r\n<h4>PDF</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-253\" title=\"pdf-file-logo-icon\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>I want/need good PDF support on the Nook if I ever hope for it to replace some of the things I do with self-published documents (e.g. agendas, reports, reference materials), and PDF is the dominant formatted document format on the web.  The current rev of the Nook software (1.0.0) has very underwhelming support for PDF.  If the PDF is just basic text, the built-in reader does a fair job of scaling and paging through the content.  If there are full-screen pages with a mixture of text and images it either renders them too small to see (with no easy zoom) or fails to render them completely.  I tried loading some schedules for local art and music festivals onto the device, which I could read fine on my computer at home, and they would not even render on the Nook.\r\n\r\nThe good news here is that there are better PDF-readers already working on the Nook, but you have to \"root\' the device and install an alternative version of Android (the base operating system of the Nook) on the Nook to add other native Android applications (several of which are more full-powered PDF readers).  So this is something that Barnes &amp; Noble could (and should) fix if enough people remind them that they need to do this soon.  The Nook has plenty of horsepower to do a much better job of PDF rendering.\r\n<h4>Search Speed</h4>\r\nI tried a few times to search for a key word or phrase in the <em>Penrod</em> book during a book club discussion - thinking it would search \"close\" to the page I was on and show me where the word was used.  Instead the reader took 30+ seconds to search the entire text of the book and show me every usage of the word(s) throughout the entire book.  Not only did this take way too long (having written search algorithms on far bigger sets of data on lesser-powered machines) but it ended up not being helpful at all as I lost the context of the page that I was on and had to page through the search results.  With the extra space on the device, it could index the contents and store the results to provide a \"nearest found\" search result, much faster, with the option for the complete search as well.\r\n<h4>Annotations</h4>\r\nUsing the touch screen you can put-and-hold your finger on any word to select the word.  Then you have the option to get a quick dictionary definition (works very nice), leave a \"highlight\" on the word, or add a note (with a surprisingly responsive pop-up keyboard).  But selecting a phrase or sentence is quite difficult. You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\r\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\r\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\r\n<h4>Battery</h4>\r\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\r\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-254\" title=\"bnstore\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>One of the selling points of the Nook is supposed to be that you can bring it into one of their \"brick &amp; mortar\" stores and read books for free and get a bunch of incentives.  Another benefit to the store experience is the idea that there would always be someone at the store at the \"Nook desk\" to help people, give advice, and answer questions.  I must have hit a bad day last week when I swung by the Woodland Barnes &amp; Noble store.  The Nook wouldn\'t connect to the in-store network - it would connect to the bar next store, but then the Nook would immediately drop that network because it saw the Barnes &amp; Noble network (I guess the store wireless network gets top priority when it appears - which is unfortunate because the bar network was working but the B&amp;N one was not).  So I went and talked to the \"Nook Lady\".  Turns out that they haven\'t had any of the new Nooks in stock at the store so she hadn\'t really had time to use the new ones (even though there were some demo units on the front of the counter).  She didn\'t really know much about the new unit and couldn\'t help me get connected.  So this aspect was a bit disappointing, but I will try again if I am in the area.\r\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\r\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\r\nOne of the thing my old Newton did with text/books/formatted text was a basic text-to-speech (TTS) (and that was 18 years ago).  Sure it sounded like the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-244\" title=\"talking_moose\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/talking_moose1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"118\" /></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"> Talking Moose</a> but that was OK.  The Kindle has a basic \"read a book to you\" ability, which is a nearly common set of functionality nowadays.  The Nook has no headphone jack or speaker, and will not play audio books (though it certainly has enough space, enough power, and an operating system that would support it.  So to leave audio and TTS off of the Nook is a design choice -

The applications that come with the Nook to help to buy books and read them have big \"touchable buttons\" and work well with the screen.  You can turn a page by swiping/touching on the side of the page that you want to turn.  Touching in the middle of the screen brings up an option bar at the bottom for more tools\n\nThere are six smartly-placed physical buttons on the unit: the on/off button which is on the rear of the unit in the upper middle (no real risk of shutting things off unintentionally - in fact I don\'t remember ever turning it off as it sleeps on its own), the \"Nook\" button in the bottom middle which brings up the main option bar at the bottom that allows you to go to the top-level pages, and four page turning buttons which aren\'t as obvious on first look, but are my favorite and I use them constantly.  The four buttons are in two pairs on either side of the unit.  There is a slight ridge line for each button - one from the middle of the unit up and the other from the middle of the unit down.  These are for page turning and are configurable (i.e. top goes to next page or to bottom page - your choice).  For longer reading sessions it is nice to have these buttons there so you can hold the book in one hand and just \"squeeze\" a bit to turn the page.  There is an inaudible \"click\" but one that you feel to know that the button has been pressed - just enough to know you did it right and keep from accidentally pushing it, but not enough to be annoying.  I know some people turn pages with the touch screen, but I am all about the side buttons - very nice.\n\n<strong>Format</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo3.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-260\" title=\"epub-logo\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/epub-logo3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"135\" /></a>I wanted an eBook reader that I could get access to the host of free eBooks available through the Gutenberg Project and other free eBook services.  I also wanted to be able to “check out” books from our local KDL library.  The Kindle primarily uses the “ePub” book format – as do the 25+ “other\" <a href=\"http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix\">E-book Readers</a> out there - all but the Kindle which uses primarily the \"mobi\" book format.  So, while the Kindle has many/most of the free eBooks available now in the \"mobi\" format, and some libraries have started carrying some books for the Kindle, the ePub format is still the most widely supported.  This gap is closing quickly, but it is something that has been really useful to me so far.\n\nThe other thing that is attractive about the ePub format is that it has some nice computer programming APIs available for it.  All that means for me is that I can easily create ePub documents by writing computer software, which opens a world of opportunity going forward.\n<h4>Battery</h4>\n<a href=\"http://www.techrepublic.com/photos/cracking-open-the-2011-barnes-noble-nook-e-book-reader-wi-fi/6243892?seq=15&amp;tag=thumbnail-view-selector;get-photo-roto\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-251\" title=\"nookbattery\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nookbattery-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>The claim from Barnes &amp; Noble was that you could get up to two months of battery life with the new Nook.  I did the initial charge of the Nook with the charger to the wall, and it was only after about a month that it started complaining that it wanted a recharge at 20% capacity.  I have, however, plugged the Nook on to the USB cable to load books and news feeds and I know that it does charge while connected, so I am sure it got some non-trivial electrons that way.  I have also left the WiFi radio on continuously since I got the device so I know that drains the battery as well.  My gut feel is that 2 months would really be a stretch, but that 3-4 weeks may be the reality – which is really a huge improvement over tablet and phone type devices.\n\nMy one beef about the battery is that it has followed the Apple model of being not easily end-user maintainable.  All batteries lose power and capacity over time so it\'d be nice to be able to change the battery fairly easily.  There are kits available online for $15-30 with videos and the tools necessary to complete the \"operation\" - but it can be uncomfortable for end-users to have to \"crack\" the case, remove ribbon cables, and see circuit boards/screen in order to change the battery.\n<h4>Memory / Expansion</h4>\nThe Nook comes with 2 Gb of internal storage, which (ironically) doesn\'t sound like much, until you realize that the average ePub book is about 200-400kb so that is thousands of books on the device.  But, just in case there are new and different things to do with the Nook that are an order of magnitude bigger than current eBooks, the Nook also has a mini-SD slot that will take up to 32Gb of additional storage.  This is more books than you have ever read, and ever will read.  The base memory is nice, and the user-enabled expansion is overkill.\n<h4>Price</h4>\nThe base price of the new reader came out at $139, which had the nice side-effect of sending the smaller Kindle down to this price point as well.  They are still probably marking up this device 50%-75% from the production cost.  I know \"value\" as perceived by consumers is largely price-based.  So while they could probably sell the Nook at $99 and still make a nice profit, people might perceive it as being a \"cheap\" eBook and buy a more expensive competitor (strange but true).  If they can get the Nook down to $99 using some deal, or rebate, or coupon for Christmas, I think they could be a run-away bestseller.\n<h2>Needs To Improve</h2>\n<h4>PDF</h4>\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-253\" title=\"pdf-file-logo-icon\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pdf-file-logo-icon-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>I want/need good PDF support on the Nook if I ever hope for it to replace some of the things I do with self-published documents (e.g. agendas, reports, reference materials), and PDF is the dominant formatted document format on the web.  The current rev of the Nook software (1.0.0) has very underwhelming support for PDF.  If the PDF is just basic text, the built-in reader does a fair job of scaling and paging through the content.  If there are full-screen pages with a mixture of text and images it either renders them too small to see (with no easy zoom) or fails to render them completely.  I tried loading some schedules for local art and music festivals onto the device, which I could read fine on my computer at home, and they would not even render on the Nook.\n\nThe good news here is that there are better PDF-readers already working on the Nook, but you have to \"root\' the device and install an alternative version of Android (the base operating system of the Nook) on the Nook to add other native Android applications (several of which are more full-powered PDF readers).  So this is something that Barnes &amp; Noble could (and should) fix if enough people remind them that they need to do this soon.  The Nook has plenty of horsepower to do a much better job of PDF rendering.\n<h4>Search Speed</h4>\nI tried a few times to search for a key word or phrase in the <em>Penrod</em> book during a book club discussion - thinking it would search \"close\" to the page I was on and show me where the word was used.  Instead the reader took 30+ seconds to search the entire text of the book and show me every usage of the word(s) throughout the entire book.  Not only did this take way too long (having written search algorithms on far bigger sets of data on lesser-powered machines) but it ended up not being helpful at all as I lost the context of the page that I was on and had to page through the search results.  With the extra space on the device, it could index the contents and store the results to provide a \"nearest found\" search result, much faster, with the option for the complete search as well.\n<h4>Annotations</h4>\nUsing the touch screen you can put-and-hold your finger on any word to select the word.  Then you have the option to get a quick dictionary definition (works very nice), leave a \"highlight\" on the word, or add a note (with a surprisingly responsive pop-up keyboard).  But selecting a phrase or sentence is quite difficult. You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\n<h4>Battery</h4>\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-254\" title=\"bnstore\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>One of the selling points of the Nook is supposed to be that you can bring it into one of their \"brick &amp; mortar\" stores and read books for free and get a bunch of incentives.  Another benefit to the store experience is the idea that there would always be someone at the store at the \"Nook desk\" to help people, give advice, and answer questions.  I must have hit a bad day last week when I swung by the Woodland Barnes &amp; Noble store.  The Nook wouldn\'t connect to the in-store network - it would connect to the bar next store, but then the Nook would immediately drop that network because it saw the Barnes &amp; Noble network (I guess the store wireless network gets top priority when it appears - which is unfortunate because the bar network was working but the B&amp;N one was not).  So I went and talked to the \"Nook Lady\".  Turns out that they haven\'t had any of the new Nooks in stock at the store so she hadn\'t really had time to use the new ones (even though there were some demo units on the front of the counter).  She didn\'t really know much about the new unit and couldn\'t help me get connected.  So this aspect was a bit disappointing, but I will try again if I am in the area.\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\nOne of the thing my old Newton did with text/books/formatted text was a basic text-to-speech (TTS) (and that was 18 years ago).  Sure it sounded like the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-244\" title=\"talking_moose\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/talking_moose1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"118\" /></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"> Talking Moose</a> but that was OK.  The Kindle has a basic \"read a book to you\" ability, which is a nearly common set of functionality nowadays.  The Nook has no headphone jack or speaker, and will not play audio books (though it certainly has enough space, enough power, and an operating system that would support it.  So to leave audio and TTS off of the Nook is a design choice - to focus on the readability of books and really very little else.  This is a \"missing feature\" but I am not sure that I miss it that much.  I have an iPod and a phone that plays MP3s, and I like to read books (which is why I got the Nook).\n<h4>Color?</h4>\nIf you had a TV that \"went back\" to black and white that would be quite silly - same with just about any other technology.  The iPad screen and iPhone screens are very nice, and the Nook Color is a great and inexpensive tablet.  They can play games and people do read books on the iPad (even if the eye strain is measurably more intense over a period of time).  I think the problem here is two things: (1) glare/outdoor reading and (2) battery life.  I have read my Nook in direct sunlight with sunglasses on and it works like a charm - other people who stopped to look were really amazed.  Many people couldn\'t even see their cell phones in the direct sun.  It is a great screen in all lighting conditions (except dark in bed) and from just about any angle.  Also a backlit and full-color screen uses a great deal of power and causes such devices to need daily recharges - a fact I really appreciate about the Nook.  There are some great E Ink Color Screen like the <a href=\"http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/demo\">Mirasol screen</a>, but they aren\'t in real production yet.  Maybe when those screens hit prime time we\'ll see a nice color E-book Reader.\n<h4>RSS / News Reader / Browser</h4>\nThere is a \"hidden\" browser on the nook - just type in something that looks like a web address (e.g. bn.com) and it will open in a browser that works via the wifi connection.  The browser is really bad. There is a reason it isn\'t obvious.  If a web site has a functional mobile-formatted web site, then it has a chance of working.  If not, most of the time you get a blank white screen.  I read daily news in the morning and it would sure be nice to have a set of web sites that were set up to work with the Nook browser.  I know the main \"point\" of the Nook for B&amp;N is to sell books, and even subscriptions, and \"free online news\" goes against this goal.  But it\'d be nice.  In the same vein as the better PDF reader available if you hack/root your Nook.  There are several much better browsers available for Android that could be adapted for the Nook.  I am going to leave the Nook \"stock\" for a while, but if there isn\'t progress on the PDF and Browser / Reader front then I might be tempted to try out some of the alternate operating systems.\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\n<a href=\"http://calibre-ebook.com/\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-269\" title=\"calibre-logo\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/calibre-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"169\" height=\"112\" /></a>This will probably be another post entirely - as this review is already 2-3x too long.  But I have to mention the<a href=\"http://calibre-ebook.com/\"> Calibre software</a> for your personal computer.  Calibre handles a bunch of the issues I mentioned in this review and adds an entire new dimension to the Nook (and other E-book Readers).  It will help you to find free books, download them, catalog them, transfer them to your Nook.  It will also subscribe to any syndicated news feed or blog on the internet and will automatically grab them on a scheduled basis (and move them to your Nook).  This has really be a lifesaver for me in the news area and I am using it to catalog the literally hundreds of public domain books that are available online.\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation, but the first month with the Nook has been really positive.  I want to do some experiments with the ePub library and create some online reports and materials that work well with the Nook.  The Nook has replaced many of my book needs and has great potential.  I look forward to news and updates from Barnes &amp; Noble that might fill in some of the gaps that the 1.0.0 version has.  I\'ll keep you updated.','Nook Simple Touch Reader - First Month','','inherit','open','open','','232-revision-27','','','2011-07-06 21:01:38','2011-07-07 01:01:38','',232,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/232-revision-27/',0,'revision','',0),(272,2,'2011-07-06 21:04:37','2011-07-07 01:04:37','<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nooktouch.jpg\">\n</a>For Father’s Day this year I got a new Nook “Simple Touch Reader” so I have had it for about a month – time for a review.  I figure it was time when the “battery warning” came on yesterday and it told me I was down to 20% of capacity, so I decided to charge it up.  Going for a little over a month on the original 9 hour charge is one of the best aspects of this device.\n\nGetting right to the point, I am very happy with the overall performance and features of the Nook – the size, screen, user experience, format, battery life, price and storage capacity create a great package for casual and serious reading.\n<h2>Books on my Nook</h2>\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/cooking-for-geeks.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-246\" title=\"cooking-for-geeks\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/cooking-for-geeks-260x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"156\" height=\"180\" /></a>In the month I have had the Nook, I have read several complete books on the device.  A typical “Nook day” for me will start at 7:00am with some devotions and current events with the family (more on the news feeds and features a little later).  Our summer “book club” has taken us through <em><strong>Penrod</strong></em> by Booth Tarkington, and now mid-way through <em><strong>The Princess and the Goblin</strong></em> by George MacDonald.  After hearing a lot of chatter online, I “checked out” <em><strong>A Game of Thrones</strong></em> by George R.R Martin from the Kent District Library (KDL) / Midwest Collaborative for Library Services (MCLS).  I also got <em><strong>How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming</strong></em> by Mike Brown, and <em><strong>SEAL Team Six</strong></em> by Howard E. Wasdin, mainly because I liked the titles, but also because I was curious about more background of recent events.  I added some PDF study guides made from Word files for some Microsoft certification tests I am studying for as well (more on the lackluster PDF support of the Nook below as well). I added <em><strong>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</strong></em> by Steve Martin because we were going to see his bluegrass band perform and I thought it would be interesting to go deeper into his life.  And I am 27 weeks into a 44-week study of <em><strong>Systematic Theology</strong></em>, so I bought the Nook version of the book (don’t have to carry the 1,200+ page tome around any more).  Of the 10-12 books on my Nook, I have completed two, skimmed seven or eight, and am in process (and plan to finish) another three – two or three are just pretty book covers on my “Library” screen – so overall pretty typical for me.\n<h2>Nook Features</h2>\nI have avoided this round of eReaders like the Kindle and previous Nooks because I thought they lacked some important features.  Now with the new Nook I am going to try it out and see how well it works for me - can it replace print books for the majority of the reading that I do?\n<h4>Size</h4>\nThe size of the Nook appealed to me, and has served me very well – it is about the size and thickness of a paperback book.  I loaded an eBook reader on the iPod Touch and tried to read through a few chapters of a few books.  The iPod was too small to really be good for text, and it was so thin that it really didn’t fit well in my hand for extended reading.  The Nook has a “rubberized” feel to it, and the back has some ridges in it, that really enable it to be held and read for an extended period of time.\n<h4>Screen</h4>\nI’ll admit going back to a black and white screen seemed to be a big negative about the reader – especially when one of the Nook’s predecessors is the Nook Color. But now I am sold.  The black and white contrast ratios (“distance” from black to white) on my old Apple Newton or Palm Pilot (which I brought out for comparison) are about what you’d find on some old dot-matrix printer on newsprint.  These new “Pearl E Ink” displays are much more like a laser printer on nice white bond paper – as good, or better than most paperbacks and close to some hardcovers. I’m told the screen is “only” 167 pixels-per-inch (ppi), and laser printers are more in the 300-1200 dpi, but the resolution is really great to read as it is for an extended period of time, and the contrast ratio makes the text almost black and the background almost white.\n<h4>User Experience (UX)</h4>\nBy getting rid of the keyboard and bottom button bar on the previous Kindle and Nook and going with a touch screen, the new Nook has maximized the screen for reading and created a very effective user interface.

You are supposed to grab one of the \"handles\" at the end of the highlight and drag it to the end of the content, which inevitably end up with extra letters at the end or too few selected.  It would be nice if there was a way to \"draw\" on the page and circle and annotate the book for future review and reference.  They could even sell a stylus that would react to the touch-screen technology (like they have for the iPad) that serious markup/annotators could use when reading.\n<h4>Screen Refresh</h4>\nThe upside of the Nook E Ink screen is that it only really uses battery/energy when the screen is updated - otherwise the image stays put.  To fully update the screen, it looks like the screen is blacked out, and then whited out, and then redrawn with the new text (kind of like erasing an Etch-a-Sketch).  The downside of this is a lot of flicker (which I am told is much better than previous versions, but it is still noticeable and takes away from the experience).  They try to get around this flicker by only fully redrawing the screen every 5-6 screen draws.  What this does is leave a faint \"ghosting\" of the previous content on the screen - barely noticeable unless the previous page was significantly different, but still there.  This speeds things up but can cause \"artifacts\" on the screen.  I thought it was more like \"burn in\" when I saw the faint image of a button from the home screen on some subsequent pages.  But then it went away when I had gone far enough ahead.\n<h4>Battery</h4>\nAs before, I want to be able to have a spare/charged battery and/or be able to change the battery myself.  My iPod Touch is down to about 3 hours of battery life now and Apple wants $75 to have them change the battery - techno-extortion is not nice.\n<h4>\"In Store Experience\"</h4>\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-254\" title=\"bnstore\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bnstore-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>One of the selling points of the Nook is supposed to be that you can bring it into one of their \"brick &amp; mortar\" stores and read books for free and get a bunch of incentives.  Another benefit to the store experience is the idea that there would always be someone at the store at the \"Nook desk\" to help people, give advice, and answer questions.  I must have hit a bad day last week when I swung by the Woodland Barnes &amp; Noble store.  The Nook wouldn\'t connect to the in-store network - it would connect to the bar next store, but then the Nook would immediately drop that network because it saw the Barnes &amp; Noble network (I guess the store wireless network gets top priority when it appears - which is unfortunate because the bar network was working but the B&amp;N one was not).  So I went and talked to the \"Nook Lady\".  Turns out that they haven\'t had any of the new Nooks in stock at the store so she hadn\'t really had time to use the new ones (even though there were some demo units on the front of the counter).  She didn\'t really know much about the new unit and couldn\'t help me get connected.  So this aspect was a bit disappointing, but I will try again if I am in the area.\n<h2>Missing Features</h2>\n<h4>Text-To-Speech / Audio?</h4>\nOne of the thing my old Newton did with text/books/formatted text was a basic text-to-speech (TTS) (and that was 18 years ago).  Sure it sounded like the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-244\" title=\"talking_moose\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/talking_moose1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"118\" /></a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Moose\"> Talking Moose</a> but that was OK.  The Kindle has a basic \"read a book to you\" ability, which is a nearly common set of functionality nowadays.  The Nook has no headphone jack or speaker, and will not play audio books (though it certainly has enough space, enough power, and an operating system that would support it.  So to leave audio and TTS off of the Nook is a design choice - to focus on the readability of books and really very little else.  This is a \"missing feature\" but I am not sure that I miss it that much.  I have an iPod and a phone that plays MP3s, and I like to read books (which is why I got the Nook).\n<h4>Color?</h4>\nIf you had a TV that \"went back\" to black and white that would be quite silly - same with just about any other technology.  The iPad screen and iPhone screens are very nice, and the Nook Color is a great and inexpensive tablet.  They can play games and people do read books on the iPad (even if the eye strain is measurably more intense over a period of time).  I think the problem here is two things: (1) glare/outdoor reading and (2) battery life.  I have read my Nook in direct sunlight with sunglasses on and it works like a charm - other people who stopped to look were really amazed.  Many people couldn\'t even see their cell phones in the direct sun.  It is a great screen in all lighting conditions (except dark in bed) and from just about any angle.  Also a backlit and full-color screen uses a great deal of power and causes such devices to need daily recharges - a fact I really appreciate about the Nook.  There are some great E Ink Color Screen like the <a href=\"http://www.mirasoldisplays.com/demo\">Mirasol screen</a>, but they aren\'t in real production yet.  Maybe when those screens hit prime time we\'ll see a nice color E-book Reader.\n<h4>RSS / News Reader / Browser</h4>\nThere is a \"hidden\" browser on the nook - just type in something that looks like a web address (e.g. bn.com) and it will open in a browser that works via the wifi connection.  The browser is really bad. There is a reason it isn\'t obvious.  If a web site has a functional mobile-formatted web site, then it has a chance of working.  If not, most of the time you get a blank white screen.  I read daily news in the morning and it would sure be nice to have a set of web sites that were set up to work with the Nook browser.  I know the main \"point\" of the Nook for B&amp;N is to sell books, and even subscriptions, and \"free online news\" goes against this goal.  But it\'d be nice.  In the same vein as the better PDF reader available if you hack/root your Nook.  There are several much better browsers available for Android that could be adapted for the Nook.  I am going to leave the Nook \"stock\" for a while, but if there isn\'t progress on the PDF and Browser / Reader front then I might be tempted to try out some of the alternate operating systems.\n<h4>Calibre</h4>\n<a href=\"http://calibre-ebook.com/\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-269\" title=\"calibre-logo\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/calibre-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"169\" height=\"112\" /></a>This will probably be another post entirely - as this review is already 2-3x too long.  But I have to mention the<a href=\"http://calibre-ebook.com/\"> Calibre software</a> for your personal computer.  Calibre handles a bunch of the issues I mentioned in this review and adds an entire new dimension to the Nook (and other E-book Readers).  It will help you to find free books, download them, catalog them, transfer them to your Nook.  It will also subscribe to any syndicated news feed or blog on the internet and will automatically grab them on a scheduled basis (and move them to your Nook).  This has really be a lifesaver for me in the news area and I am using it to catalog the literally hundreds of public domain books that are available online.\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\nIt is still early to be able to give it a full recommendation, but the first month with the Nook has been really positive.  I want to do some experiments with the ePub library and create some online reports and materials that work well with the Nook.  The Nook has replaced many of my book needs and has great potential.  I look forward to news and updates from Barnes &amp; Noble that might fill in some of the gaps that the 1.0.0 version has.  I\'ll keep you updated.','Nook Simple Touch Reader -

there seems to be a need, but getting an app from fun prototype to production-ready is a bit more time than I have free in the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nSome interesting stories about getting it released and tested.  The only real hitch was that dialog box in the above image - it didn\'t like the \"light background\" option that the phone user can set if they like white in the background instead of black (for some reason).  All the other controls handled it well.  I had to do a couple backflips in Expression Blend to create a nice template that ignored the color settings and always presented the same - which is a fine resolution.\r\n\r\nA good learning experience and a helpful app - now I just need to plan my next speech.  Thinking of bringing back out the Dreyfus Model materials - that might be fun to present.','TalkTimer app for WP7','','publish','open','open','','talktimer-app-for-wp7-published','','','2011-07-06 21:36:39','2011-07-07 01:36:39','',0,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/?p=273',0,'post','',0),(274,2,'2011-07-06 21:16:42','2011-07-07 01:16:42','','tt_icon','','inherit','open','open','','tt_icon','','','2011-07-06 21:16:42','2011-07-07 01:16:42','',273,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tt_icon.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(275,2,'2011-07-06 21:16:49','2011-07-07 01:16:49','','tt_6','','inherit','open','open','','tt_6','','','2011-07-06 21:16:49','2011-07-07 01:16:49','',273,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tt_6.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(276,2,'2011-07-06 21:16:53','2011-07-07 01:16:53','','tt_5','','inherit','open','open','','tt_5','','','2011-07-06 21:16:53','2011-07-07 01:16:53','',273,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tt_5.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(277,2,'2011-07-06 21:16:59','2011-07-07 01:16:59','','tt_4','','inherit','open','open','','tt_4','','','2011-07-06 21:16:59','2011-07-07 01:16:59','',273,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tt_4.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(278,2,'2011-07-06 21:17:05','2011-07-07 01:17:05','','tt_3','','inherit','open','open','','tt_3','','','2011-07-06 21:17:05','2011-07-07 01:17:05','',273,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tt_3.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(279,2,'2011-07-06 21:17:11','2011-07-07 01:17:11','','tt_2','','inherit','open','open','','tt_2','','','2011-07-06 21:17:11','2011-07-07 01:17:11','',273,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tt_2.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(280,2,'2011-07-06 21:17:17','2011-07-07 01:17:17','','tt_1','','inherit','open','open','','tt_1','','','2011-07-06 21:17:17','2011-07-07 01:17:17','',273,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tt_1.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(281,2,'2011-07-06 21:18:13','2011-07-07 01:18:13','<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tt_1.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-280 alignnone\" title=\"tt_1\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tt_1-180x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;','TalkTimer app for WP7 published','','inherit','open','open','','273-revision','','','2011-07-06 21:18:13','2011-07-07 01:18:13','',273,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/273-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(282,2,'2011-07-06 21:19:04','2011-07-07 01:19:04','I have been part\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tt_1.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-280 alignnone\" title=\"tt_1\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tt_1-180x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','TalkTimer app for WP7 published','','inherit','open','open','','273-revision-2','','','2011-07-06 21:19:04','2011-07-07 01:19:04','',273,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/273-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(283,2,'2011-07-06 21:19:06','2011-07-07 01:19:06','I have been part\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tt_1.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-280 alignnone\" title=\"tt_1\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tt_1-180x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','TalkTimer app for WP7 published','','inherit','open','open','','273-revision-3','','','2011-07-06 21:19:06','2011-07-07 01:19:06','',273,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/273-revision-3/',0,'revision','',0),(284,2,'2011-07-06 21:19:10','2011-07-07 01:19:10','I have been part\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tt_1.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-280 alignnone\" title=\"tt_1\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/tt_1-180x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','TalkTimer app for WP7 published','','inherit','open','open','','273-revision-4','','','2011-07-06 21:19:10','2011-07-07 01:19:10','',273,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/273-revision-4/',0,'revision','',0),(285,2,'2011-07-06 21:34:58','2011-07-07 01:34:58','I have been part of the<a href=\"http://tmfortechies.freetoasthost.org/\"> Toastmasters for Techies </a> group in Grand Rapids since starting with the group about a year ago.  In fact I am Vice President in charge of Public Relations, so let me mention now that everyone should attend if they communicate or present ideas in their current job (which is everyone by the way).\r\n\r\nOne of the tasks at Toastmasters is the Timer -

just for learning – what should I tackle?&#160; It hit me - “Fractals!!!”.&#160; It seems like every computer system and programming environment that I’ve gotten since the late 80s I have seen what I could do with some of the now-classic fractal algorithms. Inspiration for this also came from Corey Hanes great feature summary of another classic, the “<a href=\"http://github.com/coreyhaines/practice_game_of_life\">Game of Life</a>”.</p>  <p>This post isn’t intended to be a detailed primer on fractals, and specifically fractals resulting from an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system\">“iterated function system” or IFS</a>, but here are the basics.&#160; Many systems in nature exhibit features that look very similar to each other.&#160; That is, leaves on a tree, mountains, crystal structures, cells, snowflakes, etc.&#160; How can we try to simulate these patterns in a simple system to generate complex results.&#160; The IFS routines in these systems are kind of like DNA in a cell.&#160; Each element in the current generation of a system doesn’t know where it came from, but does know how to create the next generation in the system.&#160; How about an example.</p>  <p>Start with a square.&#160; </p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/fractal_it1.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px;

<p>The shape you start with really doesn’t matter.&#160; What you end up with is making a “collage” of whatever shape you start with, a square is simple and fills the space nicely (which will be important later).</p>  <p>Now we need to add some simple transformation rules.&#160; We’ll do a “classic” Serpinski triangle or “gasket”.</p>  <p>A transformation rule generally has four parts: Scale, Rotation, Translation, and Probability.</p>  <p>In this case each of the three translations will scale 50% on both axes and have no rotation (0 degrees). </p>  <ol>   <li>The first will not move at all (i.e. translate (0,0)). </li>    <li>The second will be a full width horizontally away (width, 0).&#160; </li>    <li>The third will be a full width vertically away and a half-width horizontally away (width/2, width) </li> </ol>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/fractal_it2.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px;

height=\"234\" /></a> </p>  <p>These then are the simple rules that this system will run by.&#160; Each square in the system will know these rules and know how to apply them to themselves.&#160; So when told to “iterate” each square should execute each rule by creating a clone of itself, and applying the rule to it.&#160; After the iteration, the original square(s) should self-destruct as their short life is now over.</p>  <p>So what would happen with the next iteration?</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/fractal_it3.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px;

times?</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/fractal_it7.png\"><img style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px;

<p>Starts looking far different that you might have expected.</p>  <p>So how might we start to tackle this in Silverlight?</p>  <p>Actually, this should be far easier to do in Silverlight than in previous platforms because graphics and transformations are built in to Silverlight “out-of-the-box”.</p>  <p>So “Iteration 0” will be easy (just a Rectangle).</p>  <div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;

Hand-held calculators weren’t even widely available, no public Internet, 3 TV channels, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWhat we did have was an accessible programming language that came with most computers: BASIC.  In fact, there wasn’t even much software that you could buy for your computer.  You had to write your own, and the language and environment was built-in to the machine.  A little later came LOGO, and even later came HyperCard for the Macintosh.  So for a kid with access to a computer, and a little interest, motivation, and summer break, you could spend hours programming and creating basic games with text, graphics and even sound.\r\n\r\nIronically, with all the advances in 30 years we have largely lost the entry-level development environment that kids can experiment and get started with.  Sure there are free tools for .NET, Java, PHP, etc. but they start at a much higher level and have so many commands and options that it is easy to get confused.  What kids need is a “level 0” or “level 1” type environment that is limited but easy to use (and did I mention fun?).\r\n\r\nNot every kid needs to learn to write complex programs.  But a generation of kids growing up without even a basic knowledge of how computer programs are written make them unaware of how things work and end up victims or slaves of the very technology that is meant to help them.\r\n\r\nSo for the last 4-5 years I’ve been on an active search for current options for kids who are even mildly interested in programming.  They need to be risk-free (i.e. kids can play around with them without damaging anything), fun (no kid-assembly language primers here), and have the ability to scale to average homes.\r\n\r\nI have made no conclusions here, but I wanted to list the environments I am using and “tracking” currently.  We started the “Bots on the Rock” robotics club in January 2008 and that has been doing well with kids 8-15.  In just the last month I started using Kodu on the XBox 360 at home, and now on the PC with the idea of using that with the club as well.  I am going to do a quick listing of what’s available, with more details to follow.\r\n<h2>Kodu: Game Programming Lab (XBox 360, PC (in Beta)) – 400 XBox “points”</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/kodu.jpg\"><img style=\"display: inline; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"kodu\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/kodu_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"kodu\" width=\"452\" height=\"253\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe latest item on my list is <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/kodu/\">Kodu: Game Programming Lab from Microsoft Research</a>.  I put it first mainly because that is what I’ve been “talking” about on Twitter/Facebook which lead to this post (i.e. can’t explain all of this in 140 characters). <a href=\"http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/games/offers/00000001-0000-4000-8000-00005855024c?partner=RSS\">Kodu is available today for the XBox 360</a> and and Academic version is in beta test for the PC for release in the near future.  As of today I have the PC version running on my laptop and I will be working with that more over the weekend.  We’ve been using the XBox 360 version for just under a month, and all of my kids really love playing with it and are making their own games – in fact they’d rather “play” Kodu than many of the other “real” games.\r\n\r\nKodu is difficult to explain in words, and really needs to be demoed – here is one of the better YouTube videos out there.\r\n\r\n<object width=\"450\" height=\"360\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/BRz8vb6zVAw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed width=\"450\" height=\"360\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/BRz8vb6zVAw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" /></object>\r\n\r\nBasically all of the programming is done with an XBox controller (even on the PC) with a very intuitive series of “sensors” and “commands” (e.g. when I see a ball go towards it).  It also controls a very robust scene generator which enables a huge variety of terrains and elements to be included in the games.\r\n\r\nThe recent update of Kodu on the XBox 360 allows for much easier sharing of games that you have created.  You can even create multiplayer (local) games, and quickly learn about the headaches that come from multiplayer games on the same screen.\r\n\r\nThere are a whole series of posts that could be written just about this environment, but for now I’ll leave you with the links.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>NXT-G: Lego Mindstorms (PC, Mac) – Included with LEGO Mindstorms Kit ($275)</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/nxt-g.jpg\"><img style=\"display: inline; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"nxt-g\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/nxt-g_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"nxt-g\" width=\"454\" height=\"330\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://mindstorms.lego.com/overview/NXT_Software.aspx\">NXT-G is the graphical programming environment that comes with the LEGO Mindstorms Robotics kits</a>.  The environment is a “click and drag” programming surface where programs are created by stacking and ordering blocks on the screen (much like building LEGO buildings, hmmm).  Blocks are called “Move”, “Loop”, and have sensor blocks that correspond to the robotic sensors in the kit (e.g. touch sensor, ultrasonic (distance) sensor, sound, light, and now color in the 2.0 kit).  The NXT-G application is actually an implementation of National Instruments LabVIEW graphical programming software which is used professionally by engineers and scientists.  In fact, you can use <a href=\"http://www.ni.com/academic/mindstorms/\">LabVIEW to do some advanced things</a> with the robots that NXT-G will not handle.\r\n\r\nThe Education version of the NXT-G kit is now up to version 2.0 and contains separate modules for doing data logging and support new sensors like the temperature sensors.  In addition third party sensors can be added for specific needs – for example we added Compass and IRSeeker sensors from HiTechnic when we were doing our series with the robotics club on LEGO Soccer (i.e. needed to “find the ball” (bright IR source) and know “which way” was the opponent’s goal).\r\n\r\nDragging and dropping controls is quite easy for most students – in fact the biggest challenge continues to be slowing kids down and having them try to think through and plan out a solution instead of just barreling right into programming.  Probably an ongoing struggle for many programmers out there.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Small Basic (PC) - Free</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/smallbasic.png\"><img style=\"display: inline; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"smallbasic\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/smallbasic_thumb.png\" alt=\"smallbasic\" width=\"454\" height=\"345\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/cc950524.aspx\">Small Basic came out of Microsoft’s DevLabs</a> as a simple programming language for kids to get started with.  It is unique among many of the rest in that it allows for the direct entering of programming code, whereas most of the others have gone to a graphical programming language.  It also preserves a lot of the BASIC syntax (15 keywords) so it will be comfortable for many adults that are assisting and mentoring kids who are starting to program.  It also means that the age range probably scoots up a few to perhaps 10-16.\r\n\r\nThe power of Small Basic comes in it’s simplicity (look at the tool bar compared to Visual Studio, Eclipse, or any other professional tool set).  There is only so much you can do and experimentation is easy to get into and execute.  Another part of the power comes from the .NET Framework.  There are many libraries included (Flickr one is shown) and others are being developed.  If there is something you want your Small Basic program to do, that it doesn’t to right now, develop a Class in your favorite .NET language and Small Basic will be able to access the functionality.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Scratch (PC, Mac) - Free</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://scratch.mit.edu/\"><img style=\"display: inline;

It was an amazingly full day from 9:30 in the morning to 5:30 at night (with a 2.5 hour drive on either side of that), but well worth it.\r\n\r\nMaker Faire is a difficult event and concept to explain, but there is a lot of great <a href=\"http://makerfaire.com/detroit/2011/\">information on the web describing the event</a>.  I\'ve described it as \"think of a Science Fair, but for both kids and adults and multiply that by 1000, and you get close\" - you\'d still need to add in a few dashes of \"State Fair\" and \"Carnival\" and even \"Music Festival\" and maybe a little \"Car Show\" and \"Star Trek Convention\".  The main idea comes from the idea of a \"Maker\" and/or \"Hacker\" meaning people who love to invent, create, innovate, merge, and modify just about anything - from electronics and technology, to machines, to transportation, to food (growing/preparing), and inventors and tinkers of all sorts.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been a subscriber of <a href=\"http://makezine.com/\">Make Magazine from O\'Reilly </a> (the main sponsors and organizers of the Faire) since the premier issue. We\'ve had a great time making several of the projects over the years from Make, and want to do even more - even more so after the event this weekend.  This is really why I believe that the Maker Faire was an amazing success in my opinion.  We left the day with all kinds of ideas and desire to go out and create new things - with more questions than answers but inspired to see what we could do - and I really think that was the whole point of the event.\r\n\r\nThe short story, and \"take-aways\", from the day are probably this:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li> There are still things to be invented - big and little - and really the only obstacle to creating something new is imagination, time, and a little know-how,</li>\r\n 	<li>3D printing has arrived. I remember how the first computers from HeathKit and Apple came as kits with parts that you had to assemble (and even procure) yourself. This is now true with 3D printers - all the parts you need are available with instructions that are fairly easy to follow. So you can \"print\" plastic parts, pieces, toys. It is a relatively slow process now (think dot-matrix printers from years ago), but fairly quickly you can go from an on-screen 3D model to an actual part you can hold in your hand within an hour (or less).</li>\r\n 	<li>Developing custom electronics and hardware is past the early-adopter stage and going mainstream - with the Arduino and Netduino and all other similar platforms, you can have a fully functioning programmed, debugged, tested and production hardware/software project for &lt;$50 with virtually unlimited expandability (well not for $50, but you can add what you need).</li>\r\n 	<li>A little competition will drive people to create some amazing products - making learning and creating fun and challenging has some amazing results.</li>\r\n 	<li>Integrating the XBox Kinect into projects on the PC (and elsewhere) is also past the \"hacking\" stage and into the mainstream - if you can code and haven\'t tried it, you are falling behind (and I am talking to myself more than anyone).</li>\r\n 	<li>And most importantly, building a community of makers, artists, creators, learners, etc. is a main key to success - people learn and do more with a support system than alone - period.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Some Highlights</h2>\r\nWhen we approached the Henry Ford Museum at about 9:15 the traffic was already stopped about a mile or so away for parking, and I really wondered how this would work.  You see about 50-75% of the Maker Faire was outside in the parking lot of the Henry Ford Museum - taking up the entire regular parking lot.  But fortunately the Ford Corporation owns the properties across the street and we were able to use all of their parking lots.  Still, the long lines (moved quickly) of cars, and then the growing swell of people added to the initial excitement of the day.  Plus, during the walk down to the entrance you could see some of the larger elements of the Fairgrounds including the race track, MouseTrap, and huge mechanical fire-breathing dragon.  After getting our tickets we started in a tent that was sponsored/manned by the <a href=\"http://www.aahom.org/\">Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum</a>.  This was a a great start to get you thinking a bit like a scientist/inventor and was a good example of how the day was intended to be much more \"hands-on\" than just a passive experience.\r\n<h2>Bicycle Built for 7</h2>\r\nThe \"hands-on\" nature was further emphasized as we all signed a safety waiver and got a bracelet before going further (not an experience for the timid, or a \"padded playground\" here).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bigbike.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-330\" title=\"bigbike\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bigbike-218x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"218\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bike47.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-331\" title=\"bike47\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bike47-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wheelbike.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-332\" title=\"wheelbike\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wheelbike-300x238.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe first area we explored included just about every kind of wheeled transportation imaginable - and nearly all were hands-on (with a bracelet). These included bikes with tires that were 10 feet high, we fit all of us on a \"bicycle built for 7\", and Anna sat in (but didn\'t ride around this time) on a motorbike where you actually ride inside the wheel.\r\n<h2>Maker Shed</h2>\r\nThe \"Maker Shed\" (and there were several large \"circus tent\" style areas with different exhibits) was really the \"science fair\" feel part of the Faire.  We saw everything from embedded electronics, to plans for backyard <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome\">geodesic domes</a>, to solutions to cast/mold props for movie sets (including masks and forms to create any kind of alien or creature).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ezcheezeprinter.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-337\" title=\"ezcheezeprinter\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ezcheezeprinter-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/biofuels.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-336\" title=\"biofuels\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/biofuels-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/knitfrog.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-338\" title=\"knitfrog\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/knitfrog-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\nA few examples ... yes, if you look closely, that is an \"Easy Cheeze Printer\" that you could print your name in cheese on a cracker.  Next is me talking to a guy who really reminded me of LeVarr Burton explaining how he used a fairly simple process to work with kids to create BioFuels from corn and other organic materials.  And, at first glance you might think that is a frog undergoing dissection, but actually it is an art project representing a frog dissection using knitting (did I mention there were a huge number of crafts and craftsman at the Faire?).\r\n<h2>Free Range Learning</h2>\r\nWe took a planned break from the heat (95 in direct sunlight for most of the morning) and went inside the museum (air condition break) to the Live Stage area.\r\n\r\nWe caught the end of a presentation by Sean Casey and his Tornado Intercept Vehicle (TIV) (borrowed an image from the web)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tornadoArmor.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-341\" title=\"tornadoArmor\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tornadoArmor-300x179.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"179\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis is a highly modified SUV with heavy weights and ground effects (to stop the tornado from lifting the vehicle).  The \"turret\" on top is actually a mounted IMAX camera which enabled him to get some never-before-seen-and-lived type footage from the base of a tornado cell - which just happened to be showing at the IMAX theater in the museum as well.\r\n\r\nWe stayed through the following presentation which was a very well assembled and produced effort by Maria Anderson from the LIFT Institute at Muskegon Community College.  She has graciously put her presentation and video online at <a href=\"http://edgeoflearning.com/?p=2920\">http://edgeoflearning.com/?p=2920</a>.  She walked us through a model where really life-long learning can be achieved using a \"Maker Model\" of learning, reflecting, tweeting, collaborating, blogging, reviewing and continuing on in a cycle of continuous investigation and learning.  This is the kind of thing that really makes sense when you talk about it.  The \"Free Range\" style of learning could replace a more \"Caged/Factory\" style learning that exists in many institutions today.  Free the learner/creator and let the learning and creating flow.  Some very fun, cool, and encouraging ideas (with some actual research and backup to support it).\r\n<h2>Power Wheels Racing &amp; MouseTrap</h2>\r\nAfter a nice lunch and a chance meetup with some old friends (hey Bill and Ethan!) we headed outside to view the MouseTrap and the <a href=\"http://www.powerracingseries.org/\">Power Racing Series</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mousetrap.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-342\" title=\"mousetrap\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mousetrap-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe MouseTrap really escapes easy description - if you\'ve seen the board game, and can imagine scaling everything up to \"people-size\" (i.e. the marbles in the game are now full-sized bowling balls and the crane/towers in the game are now 3-5 stories high) and then you add a carnival/gypsy-style music/performance, then you can approach what we saw there.  It was very cool seeing how they geared, and levered, and propelled, and dropped, and flung around the bowling balls through a \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine\">Rube Goldberg</a>\" style machine that ended up dropping a 2-ton actual bank safe to simulate the smashing of the mouse in the trap.  The \"take away\" from this was probably that anything in your imagination is possible, even if you have a fairly twisted imagination, and as long as you have a lot of time on your hands.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/powerracers.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-344\" title=\"powerracers\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/powerracers-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\nRight afterwards it was on to the Power Racing Series races.  This was really fun, and something it would be fairly straightforward to get into.  Imagine (or if you were there remember) taking one of those Power Racer toys that kids have been getting for Christmas over the last 5-6+ years - you know the ones like the Jeep or Barbie car that looks like a mini-version of the vehicle but runs on a rechargeable battery and goes 1-2 miles per hour and runs over pets, etc.  So get a used Power Wheels vehicle (people nearly give them away when the first battery runs out or they have to store it for a season) and spend up to $500 fixing it up (save the receipts, re-use/recycle parts to save money) and then race it against a bunch of other crazy people who are doing the same thing.  This means hacking these toys to go 15-20+ miles per hour, with actual rubber tires, upgraded motors, welded up frames, and more (but clearly little \"wasted\" on safety devices).  It was a very entertaining event (with bonus points given for crowd-pleasing performances (even if you \"lost\" the race)) and, again, a success because the discussions of \"we could do that\" or \"how did they do that\" or \"I think my cousin has one of those in the attic\" started almost immediately.  Competition, fun, and engineering hacking - all coming together in a really fun event - win-win.\r\n<h2>Fire Breathing Dragon</h2>\r\nA highlight just because of its scale and dramatic effect was the Gon-KiRin fire-breathing dragon\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dragon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-345\" title=\"dragon\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dragon-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://videos.mlive.com/mlive/2011/07/maker_faire_detroit_gon-kirin_1.html\">MLive got some good video and follow up on this here</a>.\r\n<h2>First Robotics &amp; Kinect with Lifelong Learning</h2>\r\nHeading back inside we visited the First LEGO Robotics and FRC (full-scale robots) display.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/frc.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-346\" title=\"frc\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/frc-300x238.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe FRC bots were demonstrating their ability to recognize different inflatable rings and shapes of different colors, and manipulate them in many cool ways (shown here stacking just the circles).  These were quite impressive.  The contrast here, to me, was that the budgets for teams like this are in the $10,000-$40,000 range and the time they spend on the projects is in the 100s-1000s of hours.  Still quite impressive, and an accomplishment to be sure, with an obvious contrast with the Power Racers outside.  The nice thing about the Maker Faire is that it has the whole range of items and projects from the Makers/Hackers (e.g. Power Racers) to the higher-end Engineers (FIRST Robotics).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cloudpic.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-348\" title=\"cloudpic\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cloudpic-300x239.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"239\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFinally found the Kinect with Lifelong Learning exhibit built by friend and hacker Don Burnett, but just in time to miss him at the event.  They created a very fun (with a nice line up to try it out) kiosk with a Kinect that Washtenaw Community College has built and used to foster education and creative thinking.\r\n\r\nThis is also when the second of two camera batteries decided to die for the day so the last hour or so is memory-only ...\r\n<h2>Coke Zero and Mentos to end the Day</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cokementos.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-350\" title=\"cokementos\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cokementos-300x158.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" /></a>\r\n\r\nRight at 5:00 the guys from <a href=\"http://www.eepybird.com\">Eepybird</a> gave a wonderful educational and entertaining presentation on the wonderful world of Coke Zero and Mentos eruptions.  Throughout the day kids were able to shoot off a Coke Zero Rocket Car (Anna\'s shot out over 200ft - the temperature supposedly has a lot to do with the reaction).  At the end of the day there was a \"performance\" including 160 or so bottles and 600+ Mentos.  I found a nice <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q0en9WYpKc\">YouTube of this event here</a>.\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nI\'d really like to make this an annual trek to \"The Faire\".  It was fun, entertaining, thought-provoking, and really encouraging to the creative and adventurous parts of all of us. A good goal would also be to plan to not only attend in the future, but also participate/present in some way in the future. That is really the key part of a community - the give and take that makes us all better because of it. It would also be interesting to see if we couldn\'t do a smaller scale version of this somewhere in West Michigan, or even very scaled back with just a small group to get started. Interested?

down 70 pounds in 17 weeks.  All my \"stats\" got better - losing 10 inches on my waist, blood pressure much lower (dropped meds), and similar drops across the board.  Since this success was largely because of the encouragement and stories of other people (special thanks to my wife and Ron Hughey) that has gotten me this far, I wanted to share a little about the why/what/where of the process, what I liked and didn\'t like about the program, and where we go from here - which gets a little wordy so I\'ll add headings so you can skim if interested.\r\n\r\nThe factors in this weight-loss program are pretty straightforward: more/smaller meals, calories, protein, water, activity/exercise, sleep, and support.  Some medical weight loss programs include medication or even surgery - this was not the case with this program.  You go to the office weekly and weigh in and attend a session for support and information.  Every-other-week you see the doctor and get blood tests (which became important for me - see below).  The sessions rotate between a dietitian, exercise physiologist, and a behaviorist.\r\n<h2>Calories</h2>\r\nThe idea was to eat six times a day - small meals (150-250 calories) - and try to hit a calorie goal (1050 for me) each day (no more, no less).  The theory is that there is a minimum number of calories that you need every day (had never heard this) for your body to operate and not think it is starving.  It was interesting to talk to another person in the program who had hit a \"plateau\" and hadn\'t been able to lose weight in 2-3 weeks, then they added 200 calories to her daily plan and she had two very good weeks of weight loss in a row - on more calories.  I still need to figure out more about how that works.  Then there is the amount of calories that people burn each day just \"being alive\".  For me that was calculated at about 3250 calories per day.  There is a little scale with electrodes on it that somehow sends electricity through your body and figures out these numbers as well as fat, muscle, water percentages - again, not sure how it works, but glad it does.  So the \"magic number\" is 3,000-3,500 calories which, in theory, equates to one pound (i.e. if you eat a deficit of 3,500 calories you\'ll lose a pound, if you eat 3,500 extra calories you\'ll gain a pound).\r\n<h2>Protein</h2>\r\nI\'d heard of the Atkins-style diets where you basically cut out all carbs and super-load on protein, so when this diet started stressing protein heavily I was concerned, but this went away fairly quickly after some discussions with the doctor and dietitian.  The theory with the protein (in every meal) is that there are several factors that make your body think it is hungry.  These include having something in your stomach (i.e. eating 6 times a day instead of 3) and having your body digesting/processing food - this later process is where the protein comes in.  It takes more time and energy to process protein, which keeps your body busy / burning calories / feeling full.  And all I can say from experience is that it really does work at keeping you feel full even on a ridiculously low calorie diet.  I can eat carbs, fruit, vegetables, etc. and feel hungry very quickly.  But add some nuts, yogurt, protein bar, lean meat, etc. and you can go for several hours without really feeling hungry.\r\n<h2>Packaged/Plan Food</h2>\r\nOn this program you use the \"diet food\" you order and pick up each week at the office.  This food is engineered to provide the reduced calories but also provide the protein for the meals and snacks.  The food isn\'t great - but it also isn\'t terrible.  There are a variety of food and flavors ranging from powdered drinks and protein bars to full lean cuisine size/style microwave meals.  The routine and the pre-packaging was really what saved me during the first 4-5 weeks.  The first two weeks were brutal with basically bread/carb withdrawal and getting used to more/smaller meals and the reduced calories.  I had headaches, cravings, and generally felt nasty.  After four or five weeks things did get better, and after five weeks I had to change my diet from the regular one (more on that below).\r\n<h2>Water</h2>\r\nDrink a lot of water (64oz min per day).  Always have a drink of water ready, and even drink sometimes when you aren\'t feeling thirsty.  I had several 24oz bottles of water that I consciously kept full and tried to drink from on a regular basis.  All that you are burning off and your body is using up needs to be filtered and flushed out of you somehow - the water helps.\r\n<h2>Activity</h2>\r\nHave some kind of regular activity.  At the beginning of the diet, exercise was something that was much more of a pain to try to do.  I did the minimum, and pretty grudgingly.  As you lose weight you gain energy and it takes less energy just to move around.  I remember camping in the fall at a site where we have to hike back our equipment before we set up camp - and it is 1/3 to 1/2 a mile.  In the fall it was tiring just getting back there.  In the spring (50 pounds lighter) it was almost enjoyable getting back there fully loaded with stuff (and still lighter than in the fall with nothing).  Activity comes with losing weight, but you need activity to lose weight.  So even if you start doing the minimum it will result in actually wanting to do more in time.\r\n<h2>What I Liked</h2>\r\n<h4>The Routine</h4>\r\nI knew something about myself - that if you could just give me a set of steps: 1,2,3 - a,b,c I could follow them exactly.  If you give me a 100 calorie pack of nuts, I will eat the pack and not open another one.  If you give me a bag of nuts and say eat 100 calories and then stop, I could end up eating the whole bag.  I handle this now by taking the bag and separating it into 10 baggies of 100 calories each, and then it works.  But having the routine, logging everything I eat, drink and do for activity, works well for me.  This program had routine and weekly accountability and support.\r\n<h2>What I Didn\'t Like</h2>\r\n<h4>The Packaged Food</h4>\r\nOver the last few years we have been trying to eat more and more local fresh fruits, veggies, and lean meat from local farmers and vendors.  This program seemed to be going back a few steps in this area by eating a bunch of highly engineered and processed food.  I had to let this slide for a while at the start to get into a routine that was working for me.\r\n<h4>My Kidney Scare</h4>\r\nEvery two weeks we get blood drawn and labs done to review with the doctor.  In week five I got a call a few days later from the office telling me that my kidney/renal numbers had jumped basically from a \"1\" which was normal to a \"5\" which they had never really seen before (that high).  So I needed to go get that lab done again somewhere that could verify the number, and if verified I needed to be admitted for some tests and to get the levels back down.  To make a long story short, the lab read a \"4\" when I got there and I got to spend the night in the hospital as they did a scan of my kidney and heart - thank God both were fine.  Basically it was concluded the my body was burning a lot of fat and lean tissue in the beginning of the diet (big guys can lose 7-9 pounds in the first weeks pretty easily), I was eating a much larger proportion of protein that I was used to (and a lot of it in liquid form), I was taking medication for high blood pressure (which I am off now - hopefully for good) which was a \"water pill\" which reduces kidney function, and I had been taking ibuprofen because of the regular headaches.  In short, my kidneys were overloaded.  So I went on a \"renal modified diet\" which included a lot more fresh veggies, fruit and different protein along with some of the product (2 of 6 meals a day).  I got off the medication and stopped taking ibuprofen (and haven\'t had either since - and blood pressure is even lower without it now). My numbers were back to normal in under a week and I kept up that diet for the rest of the program.\r\n\r\nSo I did end up solving the packaged food issue (but not the way I wanted to) and the kidney issue and stayed going with the program.  This is an important thing to share because it would be pretty easy to go on this type of program without a doctor\'s supervision.  But rapid weight loss does have impacts on your body - some different than others.  I talked with some people who had liver issues and one that had problems with gallstones.  I\'m not a doctor but I can testify that if you are doing a rapid weight loss you might want to tell your doctor and get a few tests along the way.\r\n<h2>Where to Go From Here</h2>\r\nI am nervous being out of the program now.

the water helps.\n<h2>Activity</h2>\nHave some kind of regular activity.  At the beginning of the diet, exercise was something that was much more of a pain to try to do.  I did the minimum, and pretty grudgingly.  As you lose weight you gain energy and it takes less energy just to move around.  I remember camping in the fall at a site where we have to hike back our equipment before we set up camp - and it is 1/3 to 1/2 a mile.  In the fall it was tiring just getting back there.  In the spring (50 pounds lighter) it was almost enjoyable getting back there fully loaded with stuff (and still lighter than in the fall with nothing).  Activity comes with losing weight, but you need activity to lose weight.  So even if you start doing the minimum it will result in actually wanting to do more in time.\n<h2>What I Liked</h2>\n<h3>The Routine</h3>\nI knew something about myself - that if you could just give me a set of steps: 1,2,3 - a,b,c I could follow them exactly.  If you give me a 100 calorie pack of nuts, I will eat the pack and not open another one.  If you give me a bag of nuts and say eat 100 calories and then stop, I could end up eating the whole bag.  I handle this now by taking the bag and separating it into 10 baggies of 100 calories each, and then it works.  But having the routine, logging everything I eat, drink and do for activity, works well for me.  This program had routine and weekly accountability and support.\n<h2>What I Didn\'t Like</h2>\n<h3>The Packaged Food</h3>\nOver the last few years we have been trying to eat more and more local fresh fruits, veggies, and lean meat from local farmers and vendors.  This program seemed to be going back a few steps in this area by eating a bunch of highly engineered and processed food.  I had to let this slide for a while at the start to get into a routine that was working for me.\n<h3>My Kidney Scare</h3>\nEvery two weeks we get blood drawn and labs done to review with the doctor.  In week five I got a call a few days later from the office telling me that my kidney/renal numbers had jumped basically from a \"1\" which was normal to a \"5\" which they had never really seen before (that high).  So I needed to go get that lab done again somewhere that could verify the number, and if verified I needed to be admitted for some tests and to get the levels back down.  To make a long story short, the lab read a \"4\" when I got there and I got to spend the night in the hospital as they did a scan of my kidney and heart - thank God both were fine.  Basically it was concluded the my body was burning a lot of fat and lean tissue in the beginning of the diet (big guys can lose 7-9 pounds in the first weeks pretty easily), I was eating a much larger proportion of protein that I was used to (and a lot of it in liquid form), I was taking medication for high blood pressure (which I am off now - hopefully for good) which was a \"water pill\" which reduces kidney function, and I had been taking ibuprofen because of the regular headaches.  In short, my kidneys were overloaded.  So I went on a \"renal modified diet\" which included a lot more fresh veggies, fruit and different protein along with some of the product (2 of 6 meals a day).  I got off the medication and stopped taking ibuprofen (and haven\'t had either since - and blood pressure is even lower without it now). My numbers were back to normal in under a week and I kept up that diet for the rest of the program.\n\nSo I did end up solving the packaged food issue (but not the way I wanted to) and the kidney issue and stayed going with the program.  This is an important thing to share because it would be pretty easy to go on this type of program without a doctor\'s supervision.  But rapid weight loss does have impacts on your body - some different than others.  I talked with some people who had liver issues and one that had problems with gallstones.  I\'m not a doctor but I can testify that if you are doing a rapid weight loss you might want to tell your doctor and get a few tests along the way.\n<h2>Where to Go From Here</h2>\nI am nervous being out of the program now. I met three people in the program who had been in it before and were back to \"try again\".  They warn you getting into the program that the \"average person gains half the weight back\" but also that \"some people keep off the weight and lose more\" .... which I heard as saying that \"some people gain all the weight back and more\" (the law of averages being what they are).  Graduates of the program are encouraged to attend the support classes, weight in, and get the information and support of the community.  I am considering this.  I want to be in regular contact with others working through this and to be accountable to having a plan and sticking to it.  My goal is to reach 100 pounds down for the year by the end of 2011 - about 30 more pounds which would be on track with the pace I have had going.  This will mean more exercise now as you burn less calories each day when you get lighter (just being alive) - which is a good thing, but you need to increase activity to make up for it.  I have some plans for that, but it will be another change.','Losing 70 pounds','','inherit','open','open','','305-revision-5','','','2011-07-13 21:57:32','2011-07-14 01:57:32','',305,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/305-revision-5/',0,'revision','',0),(311,2,'2011-07-13 22:00:36','2011-07-14 02:00:36','','weightScale','','inherit','open','open','','weightscale','','','2011-07-13 22:00:36','2011-07-14 02:00:36','',305,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/weightScale.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(312,2,'2011-07-13 21:59:26','2011-07-14 01:59:26','Today I \"graduated\" from my medical weight loss program - down 70 pounds in 17 weeks.

that if you could just give me a set of steps: 1,2,3 - a,b,c I could follow them exactly.  If you give me a 100 calorie pack of nuts, I will eat the pack and not open another one.  If you give me a bag of nuts and say eat 100 calories and then stop, I could end up eating the whole bag.  I handle this now by taking the bag and separating it into 10 baggies of 100 calories each, and then it works.  But having the routine, logging everything I eat, drink and do for activity, works well for me.  This program had routine and weekly accountability and support.\n<h2>What I Didn\'t Like</h2>\n<h3>The Packaged Food</h3>\nOver the last few years we have been trying to eat more and more local fresh fruits, veggies, and lean meat from local farmers and vendors.  This program seemed to be going back a few steps in this area by eating a bunch of highly engineered and processed food.  I had to let this slide for a while at the start to get into a routine that was working for me.\n<h3>My Kidney Scare</h3>\nEvery two weeks we get blood drawn and labs done to review with the doctor.  In week five I got a call a few days later from the office telling me that my kidney/renal numbers had jumped basically from a \"1\" which was normal to a \"5\" which they had never really seen before (that high).  So I needed to go get that lab done again somewhere that could verify the number, and if verified I needed to be admitted for some tests and to get the levels back down.  To make a long story short, the lab read a \"4\" when I got there and I got to spend the night in the hospital as they did a scan of my kidney and heart - thank God both were fine.  Basically it was concluded the my body was burning a lot of fat and lean tissue in the beginning of the diet (big guys can lose 7-9 pounds in the first weeks pretty easily), I was eating a much larger proportion of protein that I was used to (and a lot of it in liquid form), I was taking medication for high blood pressure (which I am off now - hopefully for good) which was a \"water pill\" which reduces kidney function, and I had been taking ibuprofen because of the regular headaches.  In short, my kidneys were overloaded.  So I went on a \"renal modified diet\" which included a lot more fresh veggies, fruit and different protein along with some of the product (2 of 6 meals a day).  I got off the medication and stopped taking ibuprofen (and haven\'t had either since - and blood pressure is even lower without it now). My numbers were back to normal in under a week and I kept up that diet for the rest of the program.\n\nSo I did end up solving the packaged food issue (but not the way I wanted to) and the kidney issue and stayed going with the program.  This is an important thing to share because it would be pretty easy to go on this type of program without a doctor\'s supervision.  But rapid weight loss does have impacts on your body - some different than others.  I talked with some people who had liver issues and one that had problems with gallstones.  I\'m not a doctor but I can testify that if you are doing a rapid weight loss you might want to tell your doctor and get a few tests along the way.\n<h2>Where to Go From Here</h2>\nI am nervous being out of the program now. I met three people in the program who had been in it before and were back to \"try again\".  They warn you getting into the program that the \"average person gains half the weight back\" but also that \"some people keep off the weight and lose more\" .... which I heard as saying that \"some people gain all the weight back and more\" (the law of averages being what they are).  Graduates of the program are encouraged to attend the support classes, weight in, and get the information and support of the community.  I am considering this.  I want to be in regular contact with others working through this and to be accountable to having a plan and sticking to it.  My goal is to reach 100 pounds down for the year by the end of 2011 - about 30 more pounds which would be on track with the pace I have had going.  This will mean more exercise now as you burn less calories each day when you get lighter (just being alive) - which is a good thing, but you need to increase activity to make up for it.  I have some plans for that, but it will be another change.','Losing 70 pounds','','inherit','open','open','','305-revision-6','','','2011-07-13 21:59:26','2011-07-14 01:59:26','',305,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/305-revision-6/',0,'revision','',0),(313,2,'2011-07-13 22:00:48','2011-07-14 02:00:48','Today I \"graduated\" from my medical weight loss program - down 70 pounds in 17 weeks. Since this success was largely because of the encouragement and stories of other people (special thanks to my wife and Ron Hughey) that has gotten me this far, I wanted to share a little about the why/what/where of the process, what I liked and didn\'t like about the program, and where we go from here - which gets a little wordy so I\'ll add headings so you can skim if interested.\r\n\r\nThe factors in this weight-loss program are pretty straightforward: more/smaller meals, calories, protein, water, activity/exercise, sleep, and support.  Some medical weight loss programs include medication or even surgery - this was not the case with this program.  You go to the office weekly and weigh in and attend a session for support and information.  Every-other-week you see the doctor and get blood tests (which became important for me - see below).  The sessions rotate between a dietitian, exercise physiologist, and a behaviorist.\r\n<h2>Calories</h2>\r\nThe idea was to eat six times a day - small meals (150-250 calories) - and try to hit a calorie goal (1050 for me) each day (no more, no less).  The theory is that there is a minimum number of calories that you need every day (had never heard this) for your body to operate and not think it is starving.  It was interesting to talk to another person in the program who had hit a \"plateau\" and hadn\'t been able to lose weight in 2-3 weeks, then they added 200 calories to her daily plan and she had two very good weeks of weight loss in a row - on more calories.  I still need to figure out more about how that works.  Then there is the amount of calories that people burn each day just \"being alive\".  For me that was calculated at about 3250 calories per day.  There is a little scale with electrodes on it that somehow sends electricity through your body and figures out these numbers as well as fat, muscle, water percentages - again, not sure how it works, but glad it does.  So the \"magic number\" is 3,000-3,500 calories which, in theory, equates to one pound (i.e. if you eat a deficit of 3,500 calories you\'ll lose a pound, if you eat 3,500 extra calories you\'ll gain a pound).\r\n<h2>Protein</h2>\r\nI\'d heard of the Atkins-style diets where you basically cut out all carbs and super-load on protein, so when this diet started stressing protein heavily I was concerned, but this went away fairly quickly after some discussions with the doctor and dietitian.  The theory with the protein (in every meal) is that there are several factors that make your body think it is hungry.  These include having something in your stomach (i.e. eating 6 times a day instead of 3) and having your body digesting/processing food - this later process is where the protein comes in.  It takes more time and energy to process protein, which keeps your body busy / burning calories / feeling full.  And all I can say from experience is that it really does work at keeping you feel full even on a ridiculously low calorie diet.  I can eat carbs, fruit, vegetables, etc. and feel hungry very quickly.  But add some nuts, yogurt, protein bar, lean meat, etc. and you can go for several hours without really feeling hungry.\r\n<h2>Packaged/Plan Food</h2>\r\nOn this program you use the \"diet food\" you order and pick up each week at the office.  This food is engineered to provide the reduced calories but also provide the protein for the meals and snacks.  The food isn\'t great - but it also isn\'t terrible.  There are a variety of food and flavors ranging from powdered drinks and protein bars to full lean cuisine size/style microwave meals.  The routine and the pre-packaging was really what saved me during the first 4-5 weeks.  The first two weeks were brutal with basically bread/carb withdrawal and getting used to more/smaller meals and the reduced calories.  I had headaches, cravings, and generally felt nasty.  After four or five weeks things did get better, and after five weeks I had to change my diet from the regular one (more on that below).\r\n<h2>Water</h2>\r\nDrink a lot of water (64oz min per day).  Always have a drink of water ready, and even drink sometimes when you aren\'t feeling thirsty.  I had several 24oz bottles of water that I consciously kept full and tried to drink from on a regular basis.  All that you are burning off and your body is using up needs to be filtered and flushed out of you somehow - the water helps.\r\n<h2>Activity</h2>\r\nHave some kind of regular activity.  At the beginning of the diet, exercise was something that was much more of a pain to try to do.  I did the minimum, and pretty grudgingly.  As you lose weight you gain energy and it takes less energy just to move around.  I remember camping in the fall at a site where we have to hike back our equipment before we set up camp -

thank God both were fine.  Basically it was concluded the my body was burning a lot of fat and lean tissue in the beginning of the diet (big guys can lose 7-9 pounds in the first weeks pretty easily), I was eating a much larger proportion of protein that I was used to (and a lot of it in liquid form), I was taking medication for high blood pressure (which I am off now - hopefully for good) which was a \"water pill\" which reduces kidney function, and I had been taking ibuprofen because of the regular headaches.  In short, my kidneys were overloaded.  So I went on a \"renal modified diet\" which included a lot more fresh veggies, fruit and different protein along with some of the product (2 of 6 meals a day).  I got off the medication and stopped taking ibuprofen (and haven\'t had either since - and blood pressure is even lower without it now). My numbers were back to normal in under a week and I kept up that diet for the rest of the program.\r\n\r\nSo I did end up solving the packaged food issue (but not the way I wanted to) and the kidney issue and stayed going with the program.  This is an important thing to share because it would be pretty easy to go on this type of program without a doctor\'s supervision.  But rapid weight loss does have impacts on your body - some different than others.  I talked with some people who had liver issues and one that had problems with gallstones.  I\'m not a doctor but I can testify that if you are doing a rapid weight loss you might want to tell your doctor and get a few tests along the way.\r\n<h2>Where to Go From Here</h2>\r\nI am nervous being out of the program now. I met three people in the program who had been in it before and were back to \"try again\".  They warn you getting into the program that the \"average person gains half the weight back\" but also that \"some people keep off the weight and lose more\" .... which I heard as saying that \"some people gain all the weight back and more\" (the law of averages being what they are).  Graduates of the program are encouraged to attend the support classes, weight in, and get the information and support of the community.  I am considering this.  I want to be in regular contact with others working through this and to be accountable to having a plan and sticking to it.  My goal is to reach 100 pounds down for the year by the end of 2011 - about 30 more pounds which would be on track with the pace I have had going.  This will mean more exercise now as you burn less calories each day when you get lighter (just being alive) - which is a good thing, but you need to increase activity to make up for it.  I have some plans for that, but it will be another change.','Losing 70 pounds','','inherit','open','open','','305-revision-9','','','2011-07-13 22:03:22','2011-07-14 02:03:22','',305,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/305-revision-9/',0,'revision','',0),(316,2,'2011-07-23 18:10:19','2011-07-23 22:10:19','OK, this post will be a little “heady” for a Saturday morning but I want to reference this topic for some other work I am going to do this fall. I am planning to do some non-trivial work to get some resources and links online to help kids get into doing projects and learning about things like physics, space science, and robotics/electronics – things if you know me, you know I’ve been into for a long time. The problem with the way kids learn about these topics nowadays is that it is mostly abstract, in theories, reading, or just “on paper.” To really learn more than trivia and facts about these topics you really need to “do” things with the science, not just learn things “about” them.\n\nThere are several articles or models from people that really affect the way I am going to approach things, and have impacted my thinking about the approach to learning things. I’ll hit each of them separately and then pull them all together later as kind of an approach for what I am going to try. None of these articles or their ideas should really come as a surprise to anyone – they make sense when you read them. But the authors do a great job of describing things in a depth and detail that I never could.\n\nThe first article and model is the Dreyfus Model – which is based originally on a report by Hubert Dreyfus and Stuart Dreyfus in the early 80s called “<em>A Five-Stage Model of the Mental Activities Involved in Directed Skill Acquisition</em>.” I’ll try to link to the study itself which is in a <a href=\"http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA084551&amp;Location=U2&amp;<script type=\" target=\"_blank\">PDF file</a> (scanned in <a href=\"/mirror/dreyfusdoc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">mirror 783k</a>) – don’t read it yet, just follow along here for a minute.\n\nThis study was prepared initially for the Air Force Office of Scientific Research for the training of pilots, but its model and purpose has been used effectively for training everyone from pilots, to nurses, to chess players, foreign language learners, and even computer programmers (Google “Dreyfus Model” <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=dreyfus+model\">http://www.google.com/search?q=dreyfus+model</a> and will see lots of different results of people using it (and some people arguing against it)). I like it, so I am going to use it.\n\nTo keep this to as few words as possible, Dreyfus identifies five to seven stages of learning a new skill or domain:\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 25px; margin-left: 35px;\">\n<ul>\n	<li>Novice,</li>\n	<li>Advanced Beginner,</li>\n	<li>Competent,</li>\n	<li>Proficient,</li>\n	<li>Expert, and</li>\n	<li>Master.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\nI don’t know about you but I find that many people use terms like “Competent” and “Expert” in describing their skills but really have no objective model for putting them in one category or another. Some people move themselves from not knowing anything about a particular skill up to “Competent” just by reading a book about the topic. Others call themselves an “Expert” after completing one project using a particular skill or technology. I am reminded of an episode of “Monk” where the detective Adrian Monk is going on a boat and someone asks him if he can swim. He says he knows how to swim, and even produces a card from his wallet certifying him as a swimmer (from a correspondence course), but also admits he has never actually been in the water to try out his skills but thinks he’ll do fine. Some people are that way with technology and other domains where they have studied it in books and on the Internet but have never really “done” real-world things to use what they have learned. You learn by doing things, you don’t (can’t) really learn before you do something.\n\nWhat this model does is two important things: (1) helps better define what these stages of learning mean and (2) explains a workable model for moving people from one stage to the next.\n\nBriefly, the stages:\n<h2><strong>Novice</strong></h2>\nA novice is all about following <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">rules</span> – specific rules, without context or modification. You don’t need to “think” you just need to “do”. A rule is absolute, and must never be violated. The main thing to do here is to get experience following directions and doing the new skill. You can follow the instructions on a box of cake mix and hopefully produce a decent cake. All you are responsible for is following directions.\n\n“To improve, the novice needs monitoring, either by self-observation or instructional <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">feedback</span>, so as to bring his behavior more and more completely into conformity with the rule.”\n<h2><strong>Advanced Beginner</strong></h2>\nStill rules based, but rules start to have situational conditions. In one situation you use one rule, in other situations you use another. The advanced beginner needs to be able to identify the limited need to selectively apply different rules. So if you want a chocolate cake, follow the chocolate rule(s), if you want a vanilla cake, follow the other rule(s). If you are over 5,000ft of altitude you will need to alter the amount of some ingredients. This is still a recipe, but has a few decision points. Again, follow the different “branches” of instructions and you should be fine. It is easy to see how this could collapse into a large Novice category, but it is a step before the much larger step to Competence.\n<h2><strong>Competent</strong></h2>\nYou realize that your skill or domain is more complex than a series of rules and branches. You start to see patterns and principles (or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">aspects</span>) rather than a discrete set of rules – rules become “rules of thumb”. You are lead more by your experience and active decision-making than by strictly following rules. What is developed now are <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">guidelines</span> that help direct competent individuals at a higher level. You now are accountable for your decisions as you are not following the strict rules and context of the previous stages. You’ve made a lot of cakes and have a number of recipes. When asked to make a cake of a different type you pull from experience the best way to put a new cake together. If the new cake doesn’t work out, you are responsible. This is the critical tipping point for most people when learning a new skill – and why most people never really become “competent” in most things they learn. Here you either need to decide to just “follow the rules” or spend the time to get fully involved with and take responsibility.\n\n“Competence comes only after <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">considerable experience</span> actually coping <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">with real situations</span> …”\n<h2><strong>Proficient</strong></h2>\nAt this point your understanding of your skill or domain has become more of an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">instinct</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">intuition</span>. You will do and try things because it just seems like the right thing to do (and you will most often be right). Instead of a discrete set of different parts you can perceive a complete system. A large amount of real-world experience will show you that there are often multiple competing solutions to a specific problem and you have a “gut feeling” about which is correct. “Calculation and rational analysis seem to disappear”. Will quickly know “what” needs to be done and then formulate how to do it.\n\nProficiency is developed by exposure to a “<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">wide variety</span> of typical <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">whole situations</span>.”\n<h2><strong>Expert</strong></h2>\nAt this point you are not solving problems or making conscious decisions about things, you just “do” and it works. “Optimal performance becomes second nature.” People may ask you why you decided to do things “that way” and you may not know how to explain to them the 10 steps necessary to get from “A” to “B” because to you it was really just one step. Forcing an expert to detail the steps necessary before proceeding will often cause them to fail or second-guess. Here you think of grandma getting up at 6:00am and making biscuits from scratch for many, many years. She doesn’t measure, time, or probably even think about baking – she just does it, and it works. Very few people will attain this level in a particular skill or domain. Some estimates say 10-15 years in a particular area is required.\n\nAn Expert has experience that “is so vast that normally each specific situation immediately dictates an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">intuitively appropriate action</span>.”\n<h2><strong>Master</strong></h2>\nMastery is mostly about style. A Master of something is really just an “Expert on a roll.” Sometimes you may have witnessed someone or spent time with someone who is so good at something, and gets so caught up in doing it, that you can’t help but feel that you are watching a genius at work. I’d also say a Master is an Expert who can look back and put themselves in a Novice’s shoes and create the rules, and do the monitoring/mentoring necessary to help them move forward. If you have met a Master you remember them – by name – they are rare and you would do well to spend as much time with them as possible. An Expert basketball player could be excellent at execution and without formal thought just picture the ball going through the hoop (and it does). But Michael Jordan could do it with such style, grace and physics-defying ease that you just had to stop everything and watch him when he was “in the groove.”\n\nA Master “is capable of experiencing moments of intense absorption in his work, during which his performance transcends even its usual high level.”\n<h2><strong>The Point</strong></h2>\nIf you’ve read this far, thanks, and I’ll get to the point (1,000+ words later) – I believe that too many people today are learning just enough to be considered an “Advanced Beginner” in the vast majority of topics. Painfully this is increasingly true in science, math and technology. If you know enough to “pass the test” then that is all you need to know. The <em>No Child Left Behind </em>law was designed to keep people accountable for learning. But instead of having students be able to become Competent or even Proficient in a handful of skills, we have instead created a system where we have students stuck at “Advanced Beginner” in many more subjects – and perhaps unable to move forward. We are teaching kids that it is enough to know “about” things, but not actually “do” things.\n\nSo what can we do about it? We need to catalog and create a list of resources that will help kids get from Novice to Competent in science, math, and technology - things that will get them active in doing projects and making the connections necessary to move ahead. A lofty goal, but attainable. Many people are seeing similar voids and doing things about it. Linking and teaming with them will be key in our success.\n\nMore on this to come …..\n\nBruce\n\np.s. I need a good label for \"Level 0\" - before Novice - before you\'ve ever really started learning about a particular topic.  \"Ignorant\" is cold, as is \"Empty\" - \"Unaware\" sounds judgmental.  If you haven\'t heard of <em>Newton\'s Laws of Motion</em> it most likely isn\'t your fault, but you aren\'t quite a \"Novice\" yet in its study.  Something positive like \"ready\" or \"waiting\"  or \"willing\" - ideas are welcome.','The Dreyfus Model of Skills Acquisition','','inherit','open','open','','177-autosave','','','2011-07-23 18:10:19','2011-07-23 22:10:19','',177,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/07/177-autosave/',0,'revision','',0),(320,2,'2011-08-01 12:26:37','2011-08-01 16:26:37','I was able to attend Maker Faire Detroit 2011 this last weekend at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, MI.

I remember how the first computers from HeathKit and Apple came as kits with parts that you had to assemble (and even procure) yourself. This is now true with 3D printers - all the parts you need are available with instructions that are fairly easy to follow. So you can \"print\" plastic parts, pieces, toys. It is a relatively slow process now (think dot-matrix printers from years ago), but fairly quickly you can go from an on-screen 3D model to an actual part you can hold in your hand within an hour (or less).</li>\n	<li>Developing custom electronics and hardware is past the early-adopter stage and going mainstream - with the Arduino and Netduino and all other similar platforms, you can have a fully functioning programmed, debugged, tested and production hardware/software project for &lt;$50 with virtually unlimited expandability (well not for $50, but you can add what you need).</li>\n	<li>A little competition will drive people to create some amazing products - making learning and creating fun and challenging has some amazing results.</li>\n	<li>Integrating the XBox Kinect into projects on the PC (and elsewhere) is also past the \"hacking\" stage and into the mainstream - if you can code and haven\'t tried it, you are falling behind (and I am talking to myself more than anyone).</li>\n	<li>And most importantly, building a community of makers, artists, creators, learners, etc. is a main key to success - people learn and do more with a support system than alone - period.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Some Highlights</h2>\nWhen we approached the Henry Ford Museum at about 9:15 the traffic was already stopped about a mile or so away for parking, and I really wondered how this would work.  You see about 50-75% of the Maker Faire was outside in the parking lot of the Henry Ford Museum - taking up the entire regular parking lot.  But fortunately the Ford Corporation owns the properties across the street and we were able to use all of their parking lots.  Still, the long lines (moved quickly) of cars, and then the growing swell of people added to the initial excitement of the day.  Plus, during the walk down to the entrance you could see some of the larger elements of the Fairgrounds including the race track, MouseTrap, and huge mechanical fire-breathing dragon.  After getting our tickets we started in a tent that was sponsored/manned by the <a href=\"http://www.aahom.org/\">Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum</a>.  This was a a great start to get you thinking a bit like a scientist/inventor and was a good example of how the day was intended to be much more \"hands-on\" than just a passive experience.\n<h2>Bicycle Built for 7</h2>\nThe \"hands-on\" nature was further emphasized as we all signed a safety waiver and got a bracelet before going further (not an experience for the timid, or a \"padded playground\" here).\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bigbike.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-330\" title=\"bigbike\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bigbike-218x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"218\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bike47.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-331\" title=\"bike47\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bike47-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wheelbike.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-332\" title=\"wheelbike\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wheelbike-300x238.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" /></a>\n\nThe first area we explored included just about every kind of wheeled transportation imaginable - and nearly all were hands-on (with a bracelet).

It was an amazingly full day from 9:30 in the morning to 5:30 at night (with a 2.5 hour drive on either side of that), but well worth it.\n\nMaker Faire is a difficult event and concept to explain, but there is a lot of great <a href=\"http://makerfaire.com/detroit/2011/\">information on the web describing the event</a>.  I\'ve described it as \"think of a Science Fair, but for both kids and adults and multiply that by 1000, and you get close\" - you\'d still need to add in a few dashes of \"State Fair\" and \"Carnival\" and even \"Music Festival\" and maybe a little \"Car Show\" and \"Star Trek Convention\".  The main idea comes from the idea of a \"Maker\" and/or \"Hacker\" meaning people who love to invent, create, innovate, merge, and modify just about anything - from electronics and technology, to machines, to transportation, to food (growing/preparing), and inventors and tinkers of all sorts.\n\nI\'ve been a subscriber of <a href=\"http://makezine.com/\">Make Magazine from O\'Reilly </a> (the main sponsors and organizers of the Faire) since the premier issue. We\'ve had a great time making several of the projects over the years from Make, and want to do even more - even more so after the event this weekend.  This is really why I believe that the Maker Faire was an amazing success in my opinion.  We left the day with all kinds of ideas and desire to go out and create new things - with more questions than answers but inspired to see what we could do - and I really think that was the whole point of the event.\n\nThe short story, and \"take-aways\", from the day are probably this:\n<ol>\n	<li> There are still things to be invented - big and little - and really the only obstacle to creating something new is imagination, time, and a little know-how,</li>\n	<li>3D printing has arrived.

It was an amazingly full day from 9:30 in the morning to 5:30 at night (with a 2.5 hour drive on either side of that), but well worth it.\n\nMaker Faire is a difficult event and concept to explain, but there is a lot of great <a href=\"http://makerfaire.com/detroit/2011/\">information on the web describing the event</a>.  I\'ve described it as \"think of a Science Fair, but for both kids and adults and multiply that by 1000, and you get close\" - you\'d still need to add in a few dashes of \"State Fair\" and \"Carnival\" and even \"Music Festival\" and maybe a little \"Car Show\" and \"Star Trek Convention\".  The main idea comes from the idea of a \"Maker\" and/or \"Hacker\" meaning people who love to invent, create, innovate, merge, and modify just about anything - from electronics and technology, to machines, to transportation, to food (growing/preparing), and inventors and tinkers of all sorts.\n\nI\'ve been a subscriber of <a href=\"http://makezine.com/\">Make Magazine from O\'Reilly </a> (the main sponsors and organizers of the Faire) since the premier issue. We\'ve had a great time making several of the projects over the years from Make, and want to do even more - even more so after the event this weekend.  This is really why I believe that the Maker Faire was an amazing success in my opinion.  We left the day with all kinds of ideas and desire to go out and create new things - with more questions than answers but inspired to see what we could do - and I really think that was the whole point of the event.\n\nThe short story, and \"take-aways\", from the day are probably this:\n<ol>\n	<li> There are still things to be invented - big and little - and really the only obstacle to creating something new is imagination, time, and a little know-how,</li>\n	<li>3D printing has arrived. I remember how the first computers from HeathKit and Apple came as kits with parts that you had to assemble (and even procure) yourself. This is now true with 3D printers - all the parts you need are available with instructions that are fairly easy to follow. So you can \"print\" plastic parts, pieces, toys.

These included bikes with tires that were 10 feet high, we fit all of us on a \"bicycle built for 7\", and Anna sat in (but didn\'t ride around this time) on a motorbike where you actually ride inside the wheel.\n<h2>Maker Shed</h2>\nThe \"Maker Shed\" (and there were several large \"circus tent\" style areas with different exhibits) was really the \"science fair\" feel part of the Faire.  We saw everything from embedded electronics, to plans for backyard <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome\">geodesic domes</a>, to solutions to cast/mold props for movie sets (including masks and forms to create any kind of alien or creature).\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ezcheezeprinter.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-337\" title=\"ezcheezeprinter\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ezcheezeprinter-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/biofuels.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-336\" title=\"biofuels\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/biofuels-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/knitfrog.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-338\" title=\"knitfrog\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/knitfrog-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\n\nA few examples ... yes, if you look closely, that is an \"Easy Cheeze Printer\" that you could print your name in cheese on a cracker.  Next is me talking to a guy who really reminded me of LeVarr Burton explaining how he used a fairly simple process to work with kids to create BioFuels from corn and other organic materials.  And, at first glance you might think that is a frog undergoing dissection, but actually it is an art project representing a frog dissection using knitting (did I mention there were a huge number of crafts and craftsman at the Faire?).\n<h2>Free Range Learning</h2>\nWe took a planned break from the heat (95 in direct sunlight for most of the morning) and went inside the museum (air condition break) to the Live Stage area.\n\nWe caught the end of a presentation by Sean Casey and his Tornado Intercept Vehicle (TIV) (borrowed an image from the web)\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tornadoArmor.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-341\" title=\"tornadoArmor\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tornadoArmor-300x179.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"179\" /></a>\n\nThis is a highly modified SUV with heavy weights and ground effects (to stop the tornado from lifting the vehicle).  The \"turret\" on top is actually a mounted IMAX camera which enabled him to get some never-before-seen-and-lived type footage from the base of a tornado cell - which just happened to be showing at the IMAX theater in the museum as well.\n\nWe stayed through the following presentation which was a very well assembled and produced effort by Maria Anderson from the LIFT Institute at Muskegon Community College.  She has graciously put her presentation and video online at <a href=\"http://edgeoflearning.com/?p=2920\">http://edgeoflearning.com/?p=2920</a>.  She walked us through a model where really life-long learning can be achieved using a \"Maker Model\" of learning, reflecting, tweeting, collaborating, blogging, reviewing and continuing on in a cycle of continuous investigation and learning.  This is the kind of thing that really makes sense when you talk about it.  The \"Free Range\" style of learning could replace a more \"Caged/Factory\" style learning that exists in many institutions today.  Free the learner/creator and let the learning and creating flow.  Some very fun, cool, and encouraging ideas (with some actual research and backup to support it).\n<h2>Power Wheels Racing &amp; MouseTrap</h2>\nAfter a nice lunch and a chance meetup with some old friends (hey Bill and Ethan!) we headed outside to view the MouseTrap and the <a href=\"http://www.powerracingseries.org/\">Power Racing Series</a>. <a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mousetrap.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-342\" title=\"mousetrap\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mousetrap-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\n\nThe MouseTrap really escapes easy description - if you\'ve seen the board game, and can imagine scaling everything up to \"people-size\" (i.e. the marbles in the game are now full-sized bowling balls and the crane/towers in the game are now 3-5 stories high) and then you add a carnival/gypsy-style music/performance, then you can approach what we saw there.  It was very cool seeing how they geared, and levered, and propelled, and dropped, and flung around the bowling balls through a \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine\">Rube Goldberg</a>\" style machine that ended up dropping a 2-ton actual bank safe to simulate the smashing of the mouse in the trap.  The \"take away\" from this was probably that anything in your imagination is possible, even if you have a fairly twisted imagination, and as long as you have a lot of time on your hands.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/powerracers.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-344\" title=\"powerracers\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/powerracers-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\n\nRight afterwards it was on to the Power Racing Series races.  This was really fun, and something it would be fairly straightforward to get into.  Imagine (or if you were there remember) taking one of those Power Racer toys that kids have been getting for Christmas over the last 5-6+ years - you know the ones like the Jeep or Barbie car that looks like a mini-version of the vehicle but runs on a rechargeable battery and goes 1-2 miles per hour and runs over pets, etc.  So get a used Power Wheels vehicle (people nearly give them away when the first battery runs out or they have to store it for a season) and spend up to $500 fixing it up (save the receipts, re-use/recycle parts to save money) and then race it against a bunch of other crazy people who are doing the same thing.  This means hacking these toys to go 15-20+ miles per hour, with actual rubber tires, upgraded motors, welded up frames, and more (but clearly little \"wasted\" on safety devices).  It was a very entertaining event (with bonus points given for crowd-pleasing performances (even if you \"lost\" the race)) and, again, a success because the discussions of \"we could do that\" or \"how did they do that\" or \"I think my cousin has one of those in the attic\" started almost immediately.  Competition, fun, and engineering hacking - all coming together in a really fun event - win-win.\n<h2>Fire Breathing Dragon</h2>\nA highlight just because of its scale and dramatic effect was the Gon-KiRin fire-breathing dragon\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dragon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-345\" title=\"dragon\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dragon-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://videos.mlive.com/mlive/2011/07/maker_faire_detroit_gon-kirin_1.html\">MLive got some good video and follow up on this here</a>.\n<h2>First Robotics &amp;

These included bikes with tires that were 10 feet high, we fit all of us on a \"bicycle built for 7\", and Anna sat in (but didn\'t ride around this time) on a motorbike where you actually ride inside the wheel.\r\n<h2>Maker Shed</h2>\r\nThe \"Maker Shed\" (and there were several large \"circus tent\" style areas with different exhibits) was really the \"science fair\" feel part of the Faire.  We saw everything from embedded electronics, to plans for backyard <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome\">geodesic domes</a>, to solutions to cast/mold props for movie sets (including masks and forms to create any kind of alien or creature).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ezcheezeprinter.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-337\" title=\"ezcheezeprinter\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ezcheezeprinter-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/biofuels.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-336\" title=\"biofuels\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/biofuels-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/knitfrog.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-338\" title=\"knitfrog\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/knitfrog-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\nA few examples ... yes, if you look closely, that is an \"Easy Cheeze Printer\" that you could print your name in cheese on a cracker.  Next is me talking to a guy who really reminded me of LeVarr Burton explaining how he used a fairly simple process to work with kids to create BioFuels from corn and other organic materials.  And, at first glance you might think that is a frog undergoing dissection, but actually it is an art project representing a frog dissection using knitting (did I mention there were a huge number of crafts and craftsman at the Faire?).\r\n<h2>Free Range Learning</h2>\r\nWe took a planned break from the heat (95 in direct sunlight for most of the morning) and went inside the museum (air condition break) to the Live Stage area.\r\n\r\nWe caught the end of a presentation by Sean Casey and his Tornado Intercept Vehicle (TIV) (borrowed an image from the web)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tornadoArmor.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-341\" title=\"tornadoArmor\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tornadoArmor-300x179.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"179\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis is a highly modified SUV with heavy weights and ground effects (to stop the tornado from lifting the vehicle).  The \"turret\" on top is actually a mounted IMAX camera which enabled him to get some never-before-seen-and-lived type footage from the base of a tornado cell - which just happened to be showing at the IMAX theater in the museum as well.\r\n\r\nWe stayed through the following presentation which was a very well assembled and produced effort by Maria Anderson from the LIFT Institute at Muskegon Community College.  She has graciously put her presentation and video online at <a href=\"http://edgeoflearning.com/?p=2920\">http://edgeoflearning.com/?p=2920</a>.  She walked us through a model where really life-long learning can be achieved using a \"Maker Model\" of learning, reflecting, tweeting, collaborating, blogging, reviewing and continuing on in a cycle of continuous investigation and learning.  This is the kind of thing that really makes sense when you talk about it.  The \"Free Range\" style of learning could replace a more \"Caged/Factory\" style learning that exists in many institutions today.  Free the learner/creator and let the learning and creating flow.  Some very fun, cool, and encouraging ideas (with some actual research and backup to support it).\r\n<h2>Power Wheels Racing &amp; MouseTrap</h2>\r\nAfter a nice lunch and a chance meetup with some old friends (hey Bill and Ethan!) we headed outside to view the MouseTrap and the <a href=\"http://www.powerracingseries.org/\">Power Racing Series</a>. <a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mousetrap.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-342\" title=\"mousetrap\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mousetrap-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe MouseTrap really escapes easy description - if you\'ve seen the board game, and can imagine scaling everything up to \"people-size\" (i.e. the marbles in the game are now full-sized bowling balls and the crane/towers in the game are now 3-5 stories high) and then you add a carnival/gypsy-style music/performance, then you can approach what we saw there.  It was very cool seeing how they geared, and levered, and propelled, and dropped, and flung around the bowling balls through a \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine\">Rube Goldberg</a>\" style machine that ended up dropping a 2-ton actual bank safe to simulate the smashing of the mouse in the trap.  The \"take away\" from this was probably that anything in your imagination is possible, even if you have a fairly twisted imagination, and as long as you have a lot of time on your hands.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/powerracers.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-344\" title=\"powerracers\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/powerracers-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\nRight afterwards it was on to the Power Racing Series races.  This was really fun, and something it would be fairly straightforward to get into.  Imagine (or if you were there remember) taking one of those Power Racer toys that kids have been getting for Christmas over the last 5-6+ years - you know the ones like the Jeep or Barbie car that looks like a mini-version of the vehicle but runs on a rechargeable battery and goes 1-2 miles per hour and runs over pets, etc.  So get a used Power Wheels vehicle (people nearly give them away when the first battery runs out or they have to store it for a season) and spend up to $500 fixing it up (save the receipts, re-use/recycle parts to save money) and then race it against a bunch of other crazy people who are doing the same thing.  This means hacking these toys to go 15-20+ miles per hour, with actual rubber tires, upgraded motors, welded up frames, and more (but clearly little \"wasted\" on safety devices).  It was a very entertaining event (with bonus points given for crowd-pleasing performances (even if you \"lost\" the race)) and, again, a success because the discussions of \"we could do that\" or \"how did they do that\" or \"I think my cousin has one of those in the attic\" started almost immediately.  Competition, fun, and engineering hacking - all coming together in a really fun event - win-win.\r\n<h2>Fire Breathing Dragon</h2>\r\nA highlight just because of its scale and dramatic effect was the Gon-KiRin fire-breathing dragon\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dragon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-345\" title=\"dragon\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dragon-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://videos.mlive.com/mlive/2011/07/maker_faire_detroit_gon-kirin_1.html\">MLive got some good video and follow up on this here</a>.\r\n<h2>First Robotics &amp; Kinect with Lifelong Learning</h2>\r\nHeading back inside we visited the First LEGO Robotics and FRC (full-scale robots) display.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/frc.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-346\" title=\"frc\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/frc-300x238.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe FRC bots were demonstrating their ability to recognize different inflatable rings and shapes of different colors, and manipulate them in many cool ways (shown here stacking just the circles).  These were quite impressive.  The contrast here, to me, was that the budgets for teams like this are in the $10,000-$40,000 range and the time they spend on the projects is in the 100s-1000s of hours.  Still quite impressive, and an accomplishment to be sure, with an obvious contrast with the Power Racers outside.  The nice thing about the Maker Faire is that it has the whole range of items and projects from the Makers/Hackers (e.g. Power Racers) to the higher-end Engineers (FIRST Robotics).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cloudpic.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-348\" title=\"cloudpic\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cloudpic-300x239.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"239\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFinally found the Kinect with Lifelong Learning exhibit built by friend and hacker Don Burnett, but just in time to miss him at the event.  They created a very fun (with a nice line up to try it out) kiosk with a Kinect that Washtenaw Community College has built and used to foster education and creative thinking.\r\n\r\nThis is also when the second of two camera batteries decided to die for the day so the last hour or so is memory-only ...\r\n<h2>Coke Zero and Mentos to end the Day</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cokementos.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-350\" title=\"cokementos\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cokementos-300x158.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" /></a>\r\n\r\nRight at 5:00 the guys from <a href=\"http://www.eepybird.com\">Eepybird</a> gave a wonderful educational and entertaining presentation on the wonderful world of Coke Zero and Mentos eruptions.  Throughout the day kids were able to shoot off a Coke Zero Rocket Car (Anna\'s shot out over 200ft - the temperature supposedly has a lot to do with the reaction).  At the end of the day there was a \"performance\" including 160 or so bottles and 600+ Mentos.  I found a nice <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q0en9WYpKc\">YouTube of this event here</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Maker Faire Detroit 2011','','inherit','open','open','','317-revision-v1','','','2011-08-01 14:08:22','2011-08-01 18:08:22','',317,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/08/317-revision-19/',0,'revision','',0),(353,2,'2011-08-01 14:08:26','2011-08-01 18:08:26','I was able to attend Maker Faire Detroit 2011 this last weekend at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, MI. It was an amazingly full day from 9:30 in the morning to 5:30 at night (with a 2.5 hour drive on either side of that), but well worth it.\r\n\r\nMaker Faire is a difficult event and concept to explain, but there is a lot of great <a href=\"http://makerfaire.com/detroit/2011/\">information on the web describing the event</a>.  I\'ve described it as \"think of a Science Fair, but for both kids and adults and multiply that by 1000, and you get close\" - you\'d still need to add in a few dashes of \"State Fair\" and \"Carnival\" and even \"Music Festival\" and maybe a little \"Car Show\" and \"Star Trek Convention\".  The main idea comes from the idea of a \"Maker\" and/or \"Hacker\" meaning people who love to invent, create, innovate, merge, and modify just about anything - from electronics and technology, to machines, to transportation, to food (growing/preparing), and inventors and tinkers of all sorts.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been a subscriber of <a href=\"http://makezine.com/\">Make Magazine from O\'Reilly </a> (the main sponsors and organizers of the Faire) since the premier issue. We\'ve had a great time making several of the projects over the years from Make, and want to do even more - even more so after the event this weekend.  This is really why I believe that the Maker Faire was an amazing success in my opinion.  We left the day with all kinds of ideas and desire to go out and create new things - with more questions than answers but inspired to see what we could do - and I really think that was the whole point of the event.\r\n\r\nThe short story, and \"take-aways\", from the day are probably this:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li> There are still things to be invented - big and little - and really the only obstacle to creating something new is imagination, time, and a little know-how,</li>\r\n	<li>3D printing has arrived.

It was an amazingly full day from 9:30 in the morning to 5:30 at night (with a 2.5 hour drive on either side of that), but well worth it.\r\n\r\nMaker Faire is a difficult event and concept to explain, but there is a lot of great <a href=\"http://makerfaire.com/detroit/2011/\">information on the web describing the event</a>.  I\'ve described it as \"think of a Science Fair, but for both kids and adults and multiply that by 1000, and you get close\" - you\'d still need to add in a few dashes of \"State Fair\" and \"Carnival\" and even \"Music Festival\" and maybe a little \"Car Show\" and \"Star Trek Convention\".  The main idea comes from the idea of a \"Maker\" and/or \"Hacker\" meaning people who love to invent, create, innovate, merge, and modify just about anything - from electronics and technology, to machines, to transportation, to food (growing/preparing), and inventors and tinkers of all sorts.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been a subscriber of <a href=\"http://makezine.com/\">Make Magazine from O\'Reilly </a> (the main sponsors and organizers of the Faire) since the premier issue. We\'ve had a great time making several of the projects over the years from Make, and want to do even more - even more so after the event this weekend.  This is really why I believe that the Maker Faire was an amazing success in my opinion.  We left the day with all kinds of ideas and desire to go out and create new things - with more questions than answers but inspired to see what we could do - and I really think that was the whole point of the event.\r\n\r\nThe short story, and \"take-aways\", from the day are probably this:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li> There are still things to be invented - big and little - and really the only obstacle to creating something new is imagination, time, and a little know-how,</li>\r\n	<li>3D printing has arrived. I remember how the first computers from HeathKit and Apple came as kits with parts that you had to assemble (and even procure) yourself. This is now true with 3D printers - all the parts you need are available with instructions that are fairly easy to follow. So you can \"print\" plastic parts, pieces, toys. It is a relatively slow process now (think dot-matrix printers from years ago), but fairly quickly you can go from an on-screen 3D model to an actual part you can hold in your hand within an hour (or less).</li>\r\n	<li>Developing custom electronics and hardware is past the early-adopter stage and going mainstream - with the Arduino and Netduino and all other similar platforms, you can have a fully functioning programmed, debugged, tested and production hardware/software project for &lt;$50 with virtually unlimited expandability (well not for $50, but you can add what you need).</li>\r\n	<li>A little competition will drive people to create some amazing products - making learning and creating fun and challenging has some amazing results.</li>\r\n	<li>Integrating the XBox Kinect into projects on the PC (and elsewhere) is also past the \"hacking\" stage and into the mainstream - if you can code and haven\'t tried it, you are falling behind (and I am talking to myself more than anyone).</li>\r\n	<li>And most importantly, building a community of makers, artists, creators, learners, etc. is a main key to success - people learn and do more with a support system than alone - period.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Some Highlights</h2>\r\nWhen we approached the Henry Ford Museum at about 9:15 the traffic was already stopped about a mile or so away for parking, and I really wondered how this would work.  You see about 50-75% of the Maker Faire was outside in the parking lot of the Henry Ford Museum - taking up the entire regular parking lot.  But fortunately the Ford Corporation owns the properties across the street and we were able to use all of their parking lots.  Still, the long lines (moved quickly) of cars, and then the growing swell of people added to the initial excitement of the day.  Plus, during the walk down to the entrance you could see some of the larger elements of the Fairgrounds including the race track, MouseTrap, and huge mechanical fire-breathing dragon.  After getting our tickets we started in a tent that was sponsored/manned by the <a href=\"http://www.aahom.org/\">Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum</a>.  This was a a great start to get you thinking a bit like a scientist/inventor and was a good example of how the day was intended to be much more \"hands-on\" than just a passive experience.\r\n<h2>Bicycle Built for 7</h2>\r\nThe \"hands-on\" nature was further emphasized as we all signed a safety waiver and got a bracelet before going further (not an experience for the timid, or a \"padded playground\" here).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bigbike.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-330\" title=\"bigbike\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bigbike-218x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"218\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bike47.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-331\" title=\"bike47\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bike47-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wheelbike.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-332\" title=\"wheelbike\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wheelbike-300x238.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe first area we explored included just about every kind of wheeled transportation imaginable - and nearly all were hands-on (with a bracelet). These included bikes with tires that were 10 feet high, we fit all of us on a \"bicycle built for 7\", and Anna sat in (but didn\'t ride around this time) on a motorbike where you actually ride inside the wheel.\r\n<h2>Maker Shed</h2>\r\nThe \"Maker Shed\" (and there were several large \"circus tent\" style areas with different exhibits) was really the \"science fair\" feel part of the Faire.  We saw everything from embedded electronics, to plans for backyard <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome\">geodesic domes</a>, to solutions to cast/mold props for movie sets (including masks and forms to create any kind of alien or creature).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ezcheezeprinter.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-337\" title=\"ezcheezeprinter\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ezcheezeprinter-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/biofuels.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-336\" title=\"biofuels\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/biofuels-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/knitfrog.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-338\" title=\"knitfrog\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/knitfrog-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\nA few examples ... yes, if you look closely, that is an \"Easy Cheeze Printer\" that you could print your name in cheese on a cracker.  Next is me talking to a guy who really reminded me of LeVarr Burton explaining how he used a fairly simple process to work with kids to create BioFuels from corn and other organic materials.  And, at first glance you might think that is a frog undergoing dissection, but actually it is an art project representing a frog dissection using knitting (did I mention there were a huge number of crafts and craftsman at the Faire?).\r\n<h2>Free Range Learning</h2>\r\nWe took a planned break from the heat (95 in direct sunlight for most of the morning) and went inside the museum (air condition break) to the Live Stage area.\r\n\r\nWe caught the end of a presentation by Sean Casey and his Tornado Intercept Vehicle (TIV) (borrowed an image from the web)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tornadoArmor.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-341\" title=\"tornadoArmor\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tornadoArmor-300x179.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"179\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis is a highly modified SUV with heavy weights and ground effects (to stop the tornado from lifting the vehicle).  The \"turret\" on top is actually a mounted IMAX camera which enabled him to get some never-before-seen-and-lived type footage from the base of a tornado cell - which just happened to be showing at the IMAX theater in the museum as well.\r\n\r\nWe stayed through the following presentation which was a very well assembled and produced effort by Maria Anderson from the LIFT Institute at Muskegon Community College.  She has graciously put her presentation and video online at <a href=\"http://edgeoflearning.com/?p=2920\">http://edgeoflearning.com/?p=2920</a>.  She walked us through a model where really life-long learning can be achieved using a \"Maker Model\" of learning, reflecting, tweeting, collaborating, blogging, reviewing and continuing on in a cycle of continuous investigation and learning.  This is the kind of thing that really makes sense when you talk about it.  The \"Free Range\" style of learning could replace a more \"Caged/Factory\" style learning that exists in many institutions today.  Free the learner/creator and let the learning and creating flow.  Some very fun, cool, and encouraging ideas (with some actual research and backup to support it).\r\n<h2>Power Wheels Racing &amp;

That is really the key part of a community - the give and take that makes us all better because of it.  It would also be interesting to see if we couldn\'t do a smaller scale version of this somewhere in West Michigan, or even very scaled back with just a small group to get started.  Interested?

It was an amazingly full day from 9:30 in the morning to 5:30 at night (with a 2.5 hour drive on either side of that), but well worth it.\r\n\r\nMaker Faire is a difficult event and concept to explain, but there is a lot of great <a href=\"http://makerfaire.com/detroit/2011/\">information on the web describing the event</a>.  I\'ve described it as \"think of a Science Fair, but for both kids and adults and multiply that by 1000, and you get close\" - you\'d still need to add in a few dashes of \"State Fair\" and \"Carnival\" and even \"Music Festival\" and maybe a little \"Car Show\" and \"Star Trek Convention\".  The main idea comes from the idea of a \"Maker\" and/or \"Hacker\" meaning people who love to invent, create, innovate, merge, and modify just about anything - from electronics and technology, to machines, to transportation, to food (growing/preparing), and inventors and tinkers of all sorts.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been a subscriber of <a href=\"http://makezine.com/\">Make Magazine from O\'Reilly </a> (the main sponsors and organizers of the Faire) since the premier issue. We\'ve had a great time making several of the projects over the years from Make, and want to do even more - even more so after the event this weekend.  This is really why I believe that the Maker Faire was an amazing success in my opinion.  We left the day with all kinds of ideas and desire to go out and create new things - with more questions than answers but inspired to see what we could do - and I really think that was the whole point of the event.\r\n\r\nThe short story, and \"take-aways\", from the day are probably this:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li> There are still things to be invented - big and little - and really the only obstacle to creating something new is imagination, time, and a little know-how,</li>\r\n	<li>3D printing has arrived. I remember how the first computers from HeathKit and Apple came as kits with parts that you had to assemble (and even procure) yourself. This is now true with 3D printers - all the parts you need are available with instructions that are fairly easy to follow. So you can \"print\" plastic parts, pieces, toys. It is a relatively slow process now (think dot-matrix printers from years ago), but fairly quickly you can go from an on-screen 3D model to an actual part you can hold in your hand within an hour (or less).</li>\r\n	<li>Developing custom electronics and hardware is past the early-adopter stage and going mainstream - with the Arduino and Netduino and all other similar platforms, you can have a fully functioning programmed, debugged, tested and production hardware/software project for &lt;$50 with virtually unlimited expandability (well not for $50, but you can add what you need).</li>\r\n	<li>A little competition will drive people to create some amazing products - making learning and creating fun and challenging has some amazing results.</li>\r\n	<li>Integrating the XBox Kinect into projects on the PC (and elsewhere) is also past the \"hacking\" stage and into the mainstream - if you can code and haven\'t tried it, you are falling behind (and I am talking to myself more than anyone).</li>\r\n	<li>And most importantly, building a community of makers, artists, creators, learners, etc. is a main key to success - people learn and do more with a support system than alone - period.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Some Highlights</h2>\r\nWhen we approached the Henry Ford Museum at about 9:15 the traffic was already stopped about a mile or so away for parking, and I really wondered how this would work.  You see about 50-75% of the Maker Faire was outside in the parking lot of the Henry Ford Museum - taking up the entire regular parking lot.  But fortunately the Ford Corporation owns the properties across the street and we were able to use all of their parking lots.  Still, the long lines (moved quickly) of cars, and then the growing swell of people added to the initial excitement of the day.  Plus, during the walk down to the entrance you could see some of the larger elements of the Fairgrounds including the race track, MouseTrap, and huge mechanical fire-breathing dragon.  After getting our tickets we started in a tent that was sponsored/manned by the <a href=\"http://www.aahom.org/\">Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum</a>.  This was a a great start to get you thinking a bit like a scientist/inventor and was a good example of how the day was intended to be much more \"hands-on\" than just a passive experience.\r\n<h2>Bicycle Built for 7</h2>\r\nThe \"hands-on\" nature was further emphasized as we all signed a safety waiver and got a bracelet before going further (not an experience for the timid, or a \"padded playground\" here).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bigbike.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-330\" title=\"bigbike\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bigbike-218x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"218\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bike47.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-331\" title=\"bike47\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bike47-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wheelbike.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-332\" title=\"wheelbike\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wheelbike-300x238.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe first area we explored included just about every kind of wheeled transportation imaginable - and nearly all were hands-on (with a bracelet). These included bikes with tires that were 10 feet high, we fit all of us on a \"bicycle built for 7\", and Anna sat in (but didn\'t ride around this time) on a motorbike where you actually ride inside the wheel.\r\n<h2>Maker Shed</h2>\r\nThe \"Maker Shed\" (and there were several large \"circus tent\" style areas with different exhibits) was really the \"science fair\" feel part of the Faire.  We saw everything from embedded electronics, to plans for backyard <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome\">geodesic domes</a>, to solutions to cast/mold props for movie sets (including masks and forms to create any kind of alien or creature).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ezcheezeprinter.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-337\" title=\"ezcheezeprinter\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ezcheezeprinter-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/biofuels.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-336\" title=\"biofuels\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/biofuels-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/knitfrog.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-338\" title=\"knitfrog\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/knitfrog-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\nA few examples ... yes, if you look closely, that is an \"Easy Cheeze Printer\" that you could print your name in cheese on a cracker.  Next is me talking to a guy who really reminded me of LeVarr Burton explaining how he used a fairly simple process to work with kids to create BioFuels from corn and other organic materials.  And, at first glance you might think that is a frog undergoing dissection, but actually it is an art project representing a frog dissection using knitting (did I mention there were a huge number of crafts and craftsman at the Faire?).\r\n<h2>Free Range Learning</h2>\r\nWe took a planned break from the heat (95 in direct sunlight for most of the morning) and went inside the museum (air condition break) to the Live Stage area.\r\n\r\nWe caught the end of a presentation by Sean Casey and his Tornado Intercept Vehicle (TIV) (borrowed an image from the web)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tornadoArmor.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-341\" title=\"tornadoArmor\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tornadoArmor-300x179.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"179\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis is a highly modified SUV with heavy weights and ground effects (to stop the tornado from lifting the vehicle).  The \"turret\" on top is actually a mounted IMAX camera which enabled him to get some never-before-seen-and-lived type footage from the base of a tornado cell - which just happened to be showing at the IMAX theater in the museum as well.\r\n\r\nWe stayed through the following presentation which was a very well assembled and produced effort by Maria Anderson from the LIFT Institute at Muskegon Community College.  She has graciously put her presentation and video online at <a href=\"http://edgeoflearning.com/?p=2920\">http://edgeoflearning.com/?p=2920</a>.  She walked us through a model where really life-long learning can be achieved using a \"Maker Model\" of learning, reflecting, tweeting, collaborating, blogging, reviewing and continuing on in a cycle of continuous investigation and learning.  This is the kind of thing that really makes sense when you talk about it.  The \"Free Range\" style of learning could replace a more \"Caged/Factory\" style learning that exists in many institutions today.  Free the learner/creator and let the learning and creating flow.  Some very fun, cool, and encouraging ideas (with some actual research and backup to support it).\r\n<h2>Power Wheels Racing &amp; MouseTrap</h2>\r\nAfter a nice lunch and a chance meetup with some old friends (hey Bill and Ethan!) we headed outside to view the MouseTrap and the <a href=\"http://www.powerracingseries.org/\">Power Racing Series</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mousetrap.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-342\" title=\"mousetrap\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mousetrap-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe MouseTrap really escapes easy description - if you\'ve seen the board game, and can imagine scaling everything up to \"people-size\" (i.e. the marbles in the game are now full-sized bowling balls and the crane/towers in the game are now 3-5 stories high) and then you add a carnival/gypsy-style music/performance, then you can approach what we saw there.  It was very cool seeing how they geared, and levered, and propelled, and dropped, and flung around the bowling balls through a \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine\">Rube Goldberg</a>\" style machine that ended up dropping a 2-ton actual bank safe to simulate the smashing of the mouse in the trap.  The \"take away\" from this was probably that anything in your imagination is possible, even if you have a fairly twisted imagination, and as long as you have a lot of time on your hands.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/powerracers.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-344\" title=\"powerracers\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/powerracers-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\nRight afterwards it was on to the Power Racing Series races.  This was really fun, and something it would be fairly straightforward to get into.  Imagine (or if you were there remember) taking one of those Power Racer toys that kids have been getting for Christmas over the last 5-6+ years - you know the ones like the Jeep or Barbie car that looks like a mini-version of the vehicle but runs on a rechargeable battery and goes 1-2 miles per hour and runs over pets, etc.  So get a used Power Wheels vehicle (people nearly give them away when the first battery runs out or they have to store it for a season) and spend up to $500 fixing it up (save the receipts, re-use/recycle parts to save money) and then race it against a bunch of other crazy people who are doing the same thing.  This means hacking these toys to go 15-20+ miles per hour, with actual rubber tires, upgraded motors, welded up frames, and more (but clearly little \"wasted\" on safety devices).  It was a very entertaining event (with bonus points given for crowd-pleasing performances (even if you \"lost\" the race)) and, again, a success because the discussions of \"we could do that\" or \"how did they do that\" or \"I think my cousin has one of those in the attic\" started almost immediately.  Competition, fun, and engineering hacking - all coming together in a really fun event - win-win.\r\n<h2>Fire Breathing Dragon</h2>\r\nA highlight just because of its scale and dramatic effect was the Gon-KiRin fire-breathing dragon\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dragon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-345\" title=\"dragon\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dragon-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://videos.mlive.com/mlive/2011/07/maker_faire_detroit_gon-kirin_1.html\">MLive got some good video and follow up on this here</a>.\r\n<h2>First Robotics &amp; Kinect with Lifelong Learning</h2>\r\nHeading back inside we visited the First LEGO Robotics and FRC (full-scale robots) display.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/frc.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-346\" title=\"frc\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/frc-300x238.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe FRC bots were demonstrating their ability to recognize different inflatable rings and shapes of different colors, and manipulate them in many cool ways (shown here stacking just the circles).  These were quite impressive.  The contrast here, to me, was that the budgets for teams like this are in the $10,000-$40,000 range and the time they spend on the projects is in the 100s-1000s of hours.  Still quite impressive, and an accomplishment to be sure, with an obvious contrast with the Power Racers outside.  The nice thing about the Maker Faire is that it has the whole range of items and projects from the Makers/Hackers (e.g. Power Racers) to the higher-end Engineers (FIRST Robotics).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cloudpic.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-348\" title=\"cloudpic\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cloudpic-300x239.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"239\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFinally found the Kinect with Lifelong Learning exhibit built by friend and hacker Don Burnett, but just in time to miss him at the event.  They created a very fun (with a nice line up to try it out) kiosk with a Kinect that Washtenaw Community College has built and used to foster education and creative thinking.\r\n\r\nThis is also when the second of two camera batteries decided to die for the day so the last hour or so is memory-only ...\r\n<h2>Coke Zero and Mentos to end the Day</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cokementos.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-350\" title=\"cokementos\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cokementos-300x158.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" /></a>\r\n\r\nRight at 5:00 the guys from <a href=\"http://www.eepybird.com\">Eepybird</a> gave a wonderful educational and entertaining presentation on the wonderful world of Coke Zero and Mentos eruptions.  Throughout the day kids were able to shoot off a Coke Zero Rocket Car (Anna\'s shot out over 200ft - the temperature supposedly has a lot to do with the reaction).  At the end of the day there was a \"performance\" including 160 or so bottles and 600+ Mentos.  I found a nice <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q0en9WYpKc\">YouTube of this event here</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\n\r\nI\'d really like to make this an annual trek to \"The Faire\".  It was fun, entertaining, thought-provoking, and really encouraging to the creative and adventurous parts of all of us.  A good goal would also be to plan to not only attend in the future, but also participate/present in some way in the future.  That is really the key part of a community - the give and take that makes us all better because of it.  It would also be interesting to see if we couldn\'t do a smaller scale version of this somewhere in West Michigan, or even very scaled back with just a small group to get started.  Interested?

MouseTrap</h2>\r\nAfter a nice lunch and a chance meetup with some old friends (hey Bill and Ethan!) we headed outside to view the MouseTrap and the <a href=\"http://www.powerracingseries.org/\">Power Racing Series</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mousetrap.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-342\" title=\"mousetrap\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mousetrap-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe MouseTrap really escapes easy description - if you\'ve seen the board game, and can imagine scaling everything up to \"people-size\" (i.e. the marbles in the game are now full-sized bowling balls and the crane/towers in the game are now 3-5 stories high) and then you add a carnival/gypsy-style music/performance, then you can approach what we saw there.  It was very cool seeing how they geared, and levered, and propelled, and dropped, and flung around the bowling balls through a \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine\">Rube Goldberg</a>\" style machine that ended up dropping a 2-ton actual bank safe to simulate the smashing of the mouse in the trap.  The \"take away\" from this was probably that anything in your imagination is possible, even if you have a fairly twisted imagination, and as long as you have a lot of time on your hands.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/powerracers.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-344\" title=\"powerracers\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/powerracers-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\nRight afterwards it was on to the Power Racing Series races.  This was really fun, and something it would be fairly straightforward to get into.  Imagine (or if you were there remember) taking one of those Power Racer toys that kids have been getting for Christmas over the last 5-6+ years - you know the ones like the Jeep or Barbie car that looks like a mini-version of the vehicle but runs on a rechargeable battery and goes 1-2 miles per hour and runs over pets, etc.  So get a used Power Wheels vehicle (people nearly give them away when the first battery runs out or they have to store it for a season) and spend up to $500 fixing it up (save the receipts, re-use/recycle parts to save money) and then race it against a bunch of other crazy people who are doing the same thing.  This means hacking these toys to go 15-20+ miles per hour, with actual rubber tires, upgraded motors, welded up frames, and more (but clearly little \"wasted\" on safety devices).  It was a very entertaining event (with bonus points given for crowd-pleasing performances (even if you \"lost\" the race)) and, again, a success because the discussions of \"we could do that\" or \"how did they do that\" or \"I think my cousin has one of those in the attic\" started almost immediately.  Competition, fun, and engineering hacking - all coming together in a really fun event - win-win.\r\n<h2>Fire Breathing Dragon</h2>\r\nA highlight just because of its scale and dramatic effect was the Gon-KiRin fire-breathing dragon\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dragon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-345\" title=\"dragon\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dragon-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://videos.mlive.com/mlive/2011/07/maker_faire_detroit_gon-kirin_1.html\">MLive got some good video and follow up on this here</a>.\r\n<h2>First Robotics &amp; Kinect with Lifelong Learning</h2>\r\nHeading back inside we visited the First LEGO Robotics and FRC (full-scale robots) display.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/frc.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-346\" title=\"frc\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/frc-300x238.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe FRC bots were demonstrating their ability to recognize different inflatable rings and shapes of different colors, and manipulate them in many cool ways (shown here stacking just the circles).  These were quite impressive.  The contrast here, to me, was that the budgets for teams like this are in the $10,000-$40,000 range and the time they spend on the projects is in the 100s-1000s of hours.  Still quite impressive, and an accomplishment to be sure, with an obvious contrast with the Power Racers outside.  The nice thing about the Maker Faire is that it has the whole range of items and projects from the Makers/Hackers (e.g. Power Racers) to the higher-end Engineers (FIRST Robotics).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cloudpic.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-348\" title=\"cloudpic\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cloudpic-300x239.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"239\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFinally found the Kinect with Lifelong Learning exhibit built by friend and hacker Don Burnett, but just in time to miss him at the event.  They created a very fun (with a nice line up to try it out) kiosk with a Kinect that Washtenaw Community College has built and used to foster education and creative thinking.\r\n\r\nThis is also when the second of two camera batteries decided to die for the day so the last hour or so is memory-only ...\r\n<h2>Coke Zero and Mentos to end the Day</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cokementos.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-350\" title=\"cokementos\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cokementos-300x158.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" /></a>\r\n\r\nRight at 5:00 the guys from <a href=\"http://www.eepybird.com\">Eepybird</a> gave a wonderful educational and entertaining presentation on the wonderful world of Coke Zero and Mentos eruptions.  Throughout the day kids were able to shoot off a Coke Zero Rocket Car (Anna\'s shot out over 200ft - the temperature supposedly has a lot to do with the reaction).  At the end of the day there was a \"performance\" including 160 or so bottles and 600+ Mentos.  I found a nice <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q0en9WYpKc\">YouTube of this event here</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\n\r\nI\'d really like to make this an annual trek to \"The Faire\".  It was fun, entertaining, thought-provoking, and really encouraging to the creative and adventurous parts of all of us.  A good goal would also be to plan to not only attend in the future, but also participate/present in some way in the future.  That is really the key part of a community - the give and take that makes us all better because of it.  It would also be interesting to see if we couldn\'t do a smaller scale version of this somewhere in West Michigan, or even very scaled back with just a small group to get started.  Interested?

It was an amazingly full day from 9:30 in the morning to 5:30 at night (with a 2.5 hour drive on either side of that), but well worth it.\r\n\r\nMaker Faire is a difficult event and concept to explain, but there is a lot of great <a href=\"http://makerfaire.com/detroit/2011/\">information on the web describing the event</a>.  I\'ve described it as \"think of a Science Fair, but for both kids and adults and multiply that by 1000, and you get close\" - you\'d still need to add in a few dashes of \"State Fair\" and \"Carnival\" and even \"Music Festival\" and maybe a little \"Car Show\" and \"Star Trek Convention\".  The main idea comes from the idea of a \"Maker\" and/or \"Hacker\" meaning people who love to invent, create, innovate, merge, and modify just about anything - from electronics and technology, to machines, to transportation, to food (growing/preparing), and inventors and tinkers of all sorts.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been a subscriber of <a href=\"http://makezine.com/\">Make Magazine from O\'Reilly </a> (the main sponsors and organizers of the Faire) since the premier issue. We\'ve had a great time making several of the projects over the years from Make, and want to do even more - even more so after the event this weekend.  This is really why I believe that the Maker Faire was an amazing success in my opinion.  We left the day with all kinds of ideas and desire to go out and create new things - with more questions than answers but inspired to see what we could do - and I really think that was the whole point of the event.\r\n\r\nThe short story, and \"take-aways\", from the day are probably this:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li> There are still things to be invented - big and little - and really the only obstacle to creating something new is imagination, time, and a little know-how,</li>\r\n	<li>3D printing has arrived. I remember how the first computers from HeathKit and Apple came as kits with parts that you had to assemble (and even procure) yourself. This is now true with 3D printers - all the parts you need are available with instructions that are fairly easy to follow. So you can \"print\" plastic parts, pieces, toys.

MouseTrap</h2>\r\nAfter a nice lunch and a chance meetup with some old friends (hey Bill and Ethan!) we headed outside to view the MouseTrap and the <a href=\"http://www.powerracingseries.org/\">Power Racing Series</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mousetrap.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-342\" title=\"mousetrap\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/mousetrap-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe MouseTrap really escapes easy description - if you\'ve seen the board game, and can imagine scaling everything up to \"people-size\" (i.e. the marbles in the game are now full-sized bowling balls and the crane/towers in the game are now 3-5 stories high) and then you add a carnival/gypsy-style music/performance, then you can approach what we saw there.  It was very cool seeing how they geared, and levered, and propelled, and dropped, and flung around the bowling balls through a \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine\">Rube Goldberg</a>\" style machine that ended up dropping a 2-ton actual bank safe to simulate the smashing of the mouse in the trap.  The \"take away\" from this was probably that anything in your imagination is possible, even if you have a fairly twisted imagination, and as long as you have a lot of time on your hands.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/powerracers.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-344\" title=\"powerracers\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/powerracers-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\nRight afterwards it was on to the Power Racing Series races.  This was really fun, and something it would be fairly straightforward to get into.  Imagine (or if you were there remember) taking one of those Power Racer toys that kids have been getting for Christmas over the last 5-6+ years - you know the ones like the Jeep or Barbie car that looks like a mini-version of the vehicle but runs on a rechargeable battery and goes 1-2 miles per hour and runs over pets, etc.  So get a used Power Wheels vehicle (people nearly give them away when the first battery runs out or they have to store it for a season) and spend up to $500 fixing it up (save the receipts, re-use/recycle parts to save money) and then race it against a bunch of other crazy people who are doing the same thing.  This means hacking these toys to go 15-20+ miles per hour, with actual rubber tires, upgraded motors, welded up frames, and more (but clearly little \"wasted\" on safety devices).  It was a very entertaining event (with bonus points given for crowd-pleasing performances (even if you \"lost\" the race)) and, again, a success because the discussions of \"we could do that\" or \"how did they do that\" or \"I think my cousin has one of those in the attic\" started almost immediately.  Competition, fun, and engineering hacking - all coming together in a really fun event - win-win.\r\n<h2>Fire Breathing Dragon</h2>\r\nA highlight just because of its scale and dramatic effect was the Gon-KiRin fire-breathing dragon\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dragon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-345\" title=\"dragon\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dragon-300x218.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://videos.mlive.com/mlive/2011/07/maker_faire_detroit_gon-kirin_1.html\">MLive got some good video and follow up on this here</a>.\r\n<h2>First Robotics &amp; Kinect with Lifelong Learning</h2>\r\nHeading back inside we visited the First LEGO Robotics and FRC (full-scale robots) display.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/frc.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-346\" title=\"frc\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/frc-300x238.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe FRC bots were demonstrating their ability to recognize different inflatable rings and shapes of different colors, and manipulate them in many cool ways (shown here stacking just the circles).  These were quite impressive.  The contrast here, to me, was that the budgets for teams like this are in the $10,000-$40,000 range and the time they spend on the projects is in the 100s-1000s of hours.  Still quite impressive, and an accomplishment to be sure, with an obvious contrast with the Power Racers outside.  The nice thing about the Maker Faire is that it has the whole range of items and projects from the Makers/Hackers (e.g. Power Racers) to the higher-end Engineers (FIRST Robotics).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cloudpic.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-348\" title=\"cloudpic\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cloudpic-300x239.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"239\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFinally found the Kinect with Lifelong Learning exhibit built by friend and hacker Don Burnett, but just in time to miss him at the event.  They created a very fun (with a nice line up to try it out) kiosk with a Kinect that Washtenaw Community College has built and used to foster education and creative thinking.\r\n\r\nThis is also when the second of two camera batteries decided to die for the day so the last hour or so is memory-only ...\r\n<h2>Coke Zero and Mentos to end the Day</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cokementos.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-350\" title=\"cokementos\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cokementos-300x158.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" /></a>\r\n\r\nRight at 5:00 the guys from <a href=\"http://www.eepybird.com\">Eepybird</a> gave a wonderful educational and entertaining presentation on the wonderful world of Coke Zero and Mentos eruptions.  Throughout the day kids were able to shoot off a Coke Zero Rocket Car (Anna\'s shot out over 200ft - the temperature supposedly has a lot to do with the reaction).  At the end of the day there was a \"performance\" including 160 or so bottles and 600+ Mentos.  I found a nice <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q0en9WYpKc\">YouTube of this event here</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\n\r\nI\'d really like to make this an annual trek to \"The Faire\".  It was fun, entertaining, thought-provoking, and really encouraging to the creative and adventurous parts of all of us.  A good goal would also be to plan to not only attend in the future, but also participate/present in some way in the future.  That is really the key part of a community - the give and take that makes us all better because of it.  It would also be interesting to see if we couldn\'t do a smaller scale version of this somewhere in West Michigan, or even very scaled back with just a small group to get started.  Interested?

In reality, most entrepreneurs prefer low-risk, not necessarily original ideas which typically see something that exists already and find a way to do it better.  Similar myths about new ideas and inventions are that they are based on research and predictions about the future based on the past.  In reality the future is always a non-linear extrapolation of what has come before.  You can’t predict the future – but you can create it.  Because of this “Action Trumps Everything” (which just happens to be the title of Schlesinger’s new book.  But sometimes frequent action leads to failure, but Len noted that if you are working on new ideas “by failing you probably learn what nobody else knows”.  Facing new efforts with the idea of “affordable loss” and taking “smart small steps” with regular action leads to success over time with new efforts.\n\nI wouldn’t want to follow that presentation, but next up was a man that spoke with passion, ideas, compassion and intelligence that I have not heard from a politician in a long time – I don’t even know Cory Booker’s political party but I would vote for him for office in a minute (and be very tempted to campaign for him).  Booker is the mayor of Newark, New Jersey (who’s life and story were detailed in the movie “Street Fight”).  His inspirational stories of his life and experiences in one of the most challenged (and oldest) cities in the country covered a range of issues and ideas on topics ranging from housing, to violence, to finding the best in every person.  He struggles with many peoples’ willingness to settle for average, status quo, and things being done the way they always have been done before.  He talked about “televisionism” and quipped about the various reality TV shows that have taken up residence in New Jersey.  He challenged all of us, with all our different organizations, to not settle but rather “do something”.\n\nAfter being challenged about several “comfort zones” of leadership and ideas, Brenda Salter McNeil kicked off the afternoon with some inspiring and wise words about bridging cultural divisions in our community, country and world.  She walked us through the modern-day implications of Acts 1:8 and how we need to build community with those closest to us, those near us but with some differing views, and also those who are as different from us as possible.  She also observed that we often need catalytic events to help us to mobilize people to go and do what is necessary.\n\nWith all the different topics today, it was easy to feel like we were “channel flipping” – except the quality of the presentations were so much higher than what is available on television.  Case in point was who came next, Seth Godin.  I have read several of Seth’s books and am familiar with a lot of his ideas.  He took us through a similar theme of average efforts leading to even more average products.  He reviewed his work how modern “tribes” turning social structures upside down and the laptop being the new means of production in the information and social age.  Seth also reinforced the idea of failure as an important option and possible outcome, noting specifically that “if failure is not an option than neither is success”.  His most striking illustration is that people need to “Stop Bowling” – meaning that, the whole point of bowling is in doing a repetitive task, over and over, and just trying to do it a little better the next time.  He compared this to competition in the bottled water industry, “What are they going to do, make the water wetter?”  Do great new things, “Don’t wait to get picked – Picked Yourself!”\n\nTo cap off the day we had a challenge to not only come to the conference for ideas and inspiration, but also to turn ideas into action.  Steven Furtick is a young, energetic and gifted speaker with a contagious passion to have faith in the big things that can be accomplished by faithful people.  He took us through a modern retelling of 2 Kings 3 where the armies of Israel and Judah found themselves desperate for water.  Through the words and actions of a spirited Elisha, they found that they needed to “make the valley full of ditches” (NIV) and that God would supply the water that they so desperately needed.  We can act in many different ways, in faith, but “Only God can bring the rain.”\n\nI am looking forward to another day at the conference tomorrow, and the days afterwards as I take what I’ve learned there and found ways to put it into practice – but for now, some sleep.','Quit Bowling, and Start Digging Ditches – WCAGLS

The forward-thinking part of the article goes to \"what would Steve Jobs do\" in the years going forward in the area of the phone.  My opinions about this are here (note: this is intended to focus primarily on the \"phone\" part of the phone - that is the mostly audio synchronous conversation between two (or more) people):\n\nFuture innovations needed for the phone:\n\n1) <strong>Battery</strong> - this is true for all mobile devices.  Battery tech needs to last 10 times longer than it does right now.  In reality batteries last a day or two for a phone or tablet - this needs to be a week or more (a month?) to really be natural and unobtrusive.\n\n2) <strong>Shrink the \"phone\" part of the phone</strong> - think of your favorite action or sci-fi movie/show where people can talk to each other through an \"ear piece\" that is so small that it isn\'t visible.  Think of the small \"monitors\" that most on-stage musicians have now that fit snugly in their ear so they can move about and still get the critical feedback for their musical performance.  Why not have this as an option for everyone?  My daughter has had several molds made for her hearing aides over the years, and while there is a manual/labor process in getting a good and comfortable mold made, it is worth it.  I\'m sure with all the advances in cochlear implants (or similar devices) recently someone will want to create a phone-implant to get rid of the device entirely - I\'m really not ready to go there,if only because of Moore\'s Law and the speed that this technology is changing\n\n3) <strong>Get rid of \"phone numbers\"</strong> - we don\'t think of peoples IP number when we send them an e-mail or chat, we just have a \"name resolver\" that finds the web site or the e-mail host - do the same thing with people on their phones.  You could still have user identities that separate \"personal\" and \"work\" channels, but phone numbers are really out of date.\n\n4) <strong>Calling vs. talking.</strong>  The technology of the cell phone still seems to be in the mode where one person makes an explicit \"call\" to another person - and for many this will stick.  It\'d be cool if there were the ability (one the in-ear tech was worked out) that you could be able to \"enter and leave\" a conversation at-will throughout the day (more like \"instant messaging\" than \"calling\").  In this way you\'d be more having a conversation with another person on a regular basis rather than individual calls.\n\n5) <strong>Groups/Security for Incoming \"Calls\"</strong> - It\'d be nice to be able to be able to group the people who you\'d approve for communications at all times, during times when you are \"available\" for calls, and others that\'d go directly to voice-mail (e.g. unknown calls).  This would be especially important for the \"always-on\" aspect of voice conversations.\n\n6) <strong>Multi-person conversations.</strong>  Phone tech also seems to be stuck in the \"dyad\" idea that, in general, two people are involved in a phone call/conversation.  This again is a legacy concept for when their was basically a switched connection where one phone line was physically connected to another phone line.  It is possible to do \"three-way calling\" or even \"conference calling\" but these services are more the exception than the norm.  It needs to be easier to have a whole bunch of people in the same conversation - again, akin to the \"instant messaging in a group\").\n\n7) <strong>User interface / Screen</strong>. I\'ve consciously avoided the idea of what the \"screen\" on the phone should look like, or even how it integrates with the phone itself.  Should you have a device with a touch screen, high-definition camera, gyroscope/accelerometer, GPS, antenna, local storage, etc. paired up with your \"phone\".  It\'d be cool if this were an option, but not required.  You\'d need something to configure the features above.  And there is a reason to have a \"mobile apps\" device that you could have in addition to your \"phone\".  But to unnecessarily couple the \"apps platform\" to the \"phone platform\" will reduce innovations in both.\n\n&nbsp;','Future Phone Features','','inherit','open','open','','378-revision','','','2011-10-10 11:20:00','2011-10-10 15:20:00','',378,'http://www.bruceabernethy.com/2011/10/378-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(381,2,'2012-04-02 10:01:52','2012-04-02 14:01:52','I know that many that have been following the development and previews of Windows 8 have many opinions about the new operating system.  And while many are very positive, some have people quite concerned (e.g. the \"Lack of the Start Menu\" or \"Metro as the default interface / can\'t disable\").  But I think the fatal flaw from a business/corporate perspective may probably be the fact that the tablet/mobile/ARM versions may not be able to be centrally managed or secured by joining a domain.\r\n\r\nI had heard rumors/tweets about this but wanted to \"get it from the source\" and I did find a link to the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=28970\">Windows 8 Consumer Preview Product Guide for Business</a>.  This 16-page guide is worth a read if you are interested in such things.\r\n\r\nI was pleased to read on Page 4 in the \"Line-of-business app development\" section that ...\r\n<blockquote>\"Enterprise developers can create Windows 8 apps that are critical for their business and feel confident that they maintain control over the deployment and access to their apps.

The main goal of geocaching is to find caches/boxes that are hidden just about everywhere – these boxes don’t move (hopefully) as you couldn’t find them otherwise. If you get more into geocaching you will also find that there are “Trackables” or “Travel Bugs” that are a whole variety of items that have a custom code that actually “live in” these caches, are also trackable/loggable, and move from cache to cache.  We decided to start a few of our own Travel Bugs and see how they did.  I haven’t checked on them in a while, but when I did I was quite surprised, between our “Code Ninja”, “Snowspeeder” and “Master Chief” they have travelled 34,639.4 miles and have been to Hawaii, Kuala Lumpur, Germany, France and more.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-391\" title=\"snowspeeder\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/snowspeeder.jpg\" alt=\"\" height=\"130\" /><img class=\" wp-image-389 alignleft\" title=\"codeninja\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/codeninja.jpg\" alt=\"\" height=\"130\" /><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-390\" title=\"masterchief\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/masterchief.jpg\" alt=\"\" height=\"130\" />\r\n<h2 style=\"clear: both;\">Enter the Ninja</h2>\r\nTo start one of these Travel Bugs you need to get a tag for them online - these have a unique number for each item.  Then I found some small enough items that I had lying around the house, and yes they are a little geeky - a rubber Ninja, a small Snowspeeder and a Master Chief (from Mega Blocks) - then you drill a hole in them, but the tag on, register the code online, and you are off.  Then I seeded these items into two of the local geocaches that we set up in town.  And off they go.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ninjamap.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-399\" title=\"ninjamap\" src=\"http://www.bruceabernethy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ninjamap.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"566\" height=\"264\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI got an e-mail today that the Ninja had moved and that he was now somewhere in Germany - and the last I had heard about him he was in Boston.

Some even end up on bumper stickers.  These common phrases that seem intended to end debate and conversation. And I noticed lately that the political season really brings them out again.  But I felt awkward because I didn\'t have a term or label for them.  These phrases that we\'ve heard thousands of times that basically all end up meaning \"I am really not interested in discussing this with you.  I am sure that I am right, and I am sure that you are wrong. Or at least that is what I want to believe and this discussion is making me uncomfortable.\"  I was reminded of one of the first Internet e-mail messages that got forwarded around in the late 80s from <a href=\"http://www.ece.rice.edu/~farbod/files/how-to-win.html \">Dave Barry called \"How to Win Arguments\"</a> - it was irreverent but insightful.  In addition to the obvious strategies on winning arguments like \"Make things up\" it talked about using \"meaningless but weighty-sounding words and phrases\" and using \"snappy and irrelevant comebacks\", and also was the first time I saw the suggestion to \"compare your opponent to Adolf Hitler\" as a final straw.  But these strategies come back to mind whenever we are in the thick of a political season.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>I think I was Googling one of the phrases when I saw it listed in a group titled <a href=\"http://www.google.com/#q=thought+terminating+cliche\">\"Thought-Terminating Cliches\"</a> and thought that this was the term I\'ve been looking for - so I wanted to share. It looks like the term is based on a book from the 60s which studied brainwashing in China.  And while I am sure there is more interesting insights in the book, what I really wanted was the term.  Once we have a term to talk about we can start noticing the pattern and decide when (and when not) to use these powerful little phrases.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>So what are some examples of the phrases?

href=\"http://www.calvin.edu/academic/engl/festival/\">Festival of Faith and Writing</a> which is a conference for authors, playwrights, publishers, readers, teachers, etc.  I’ve been going to the conference since 1996, which was three years after I wrote my last/only book, but was right in the middle of the nine years I was writing monthly articles on technology in education.  So if it has been four years now since I have written anything (for money), why keep going to the conference?\r\n\r\nThe short answer is that I always learn something new, and always am reminded of things I had learned before but have forgotten (or stopped paying attention to).  I think all creative people who are working in their chosen craft share a lot of the same struggles.  These craftsmen can learn a lot from each other, whether they be authors, film makers, musicians, artists, or even people trying to create a good user interface or user experience using web sites and computer software.\r\n\r\nSo briefly below is my “Top 10+” list of things I learned or relearned this year.  Each of these items is probably a blog post or book in itself, but I don’t have time for that right now – perhaps I’ll expand on some of these in the near future.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Nothing replaces experience when conceiving and starting a project</li>\r\n 	<li>No craftsman (or woman) is an island</li>\r\n 	<li>A picture is still worth a thousand words</li>\r\n 	<li>Nothing is more inspiring than a talented craftsman with passion</li>\r\n 	<li>Give your audience something that they recognize, even/especially in brand new creations</li>\r\n 	<li>The best way to learn how to create something yourself is to regularly view/review other people’s creations</li>\r\n 	<li>Another great way to learn to to create something is to just get started creating something</li>\r\n 	<li>Spending only time with the “latest stuff” makes you “a mile wide, but an inch deep”</li>\r\n 	<li>Even the “masters” of any craft, if they are honest, will tell you of their daily struggles and fears</li>\r\n 	<li>“Process Versus Product” is a key concern for every craftsman</li>\r\n 	<li>“Picturing the Invisible” is another difficult and important skill to learn</li>\r\n 	<li>A true craftsman will be satisfied with a work well done, no matter if the audience is 2, 10, 100 or thousands of people</li>\r\n 	<li>A large motivation of craftsmen of all kinds is the puzzle, mystery or problem to be solved</li>\r\n</ul>','Lessons Learned: Craftsmen and artists of all types have a lot in common','','inherit','closed','closed','','9-revision-v1','','','2017-05-25 09:14:21','2017-05-25
